# Handling different text directions: What are writing modes

A writing mode in CSS refers to whether the text is running horizontally or vertically. The <code>writing-mode</code> property lets us switch from one writing mode to another.

In this project, we have a heading displayed using <code>writing-mode: vertical-rl</code>. The text now runs vertically. Vertical text is common in graphic design, and can be a way to add a more interesting look and feel to your web design.
    
The three possible values for the <code>writing-mode</code> property are:
    
- <code>horizontal-tb</code>: Top-to-bottom block flow direction. Sentences run horizontally.
- <code>vertical-rl</code>: Right-to-left block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.
- <code>vertical-lr</code>: Left-to-right block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.
