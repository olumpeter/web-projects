# CSS values and units: RGB values

To create **RGB values** directly, the <code>rgb()</code> function takes three parameters representing <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, and <code>blue</code> channel values of the colors, with an optional fourth value separated by a slash ('<code>/</code>') representing **opacity**, in much the same way as **hex values**. The difference with **RGB** is that each channel is represented not by **two hex digits**, but by a decimal number between <code>0</code> and <code>255</code> or a percent between <code>0%</code> and <code>100%</code> inclusive (but not a mixture of the two).
    
In the second example, we have added a **background image** to the containing block of our colored boxes. We have then set the boxes to have different **opacity values** â€” notice how the background shows through more when the alpha channel value is smaller.
    
Try changing the alpha channel values to see how it affects the color output.
