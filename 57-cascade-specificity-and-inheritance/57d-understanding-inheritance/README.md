# Understanding inheritance

The color property is an inherited property. So, the color property value is applied to the direct children and also to the indirect children. — the immediate child <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s and those inside the first nested list. We have then added the class special to the second nested list and applied a different color to it. This then inherits down through its children. Properties like <code>width</code> (as mentioned earlier), <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, and <code>border</code> are not inherited properties. If a border were to be inherited by the children in this list example, every single list and list item would gain a border — probably not an effect we would ever want!
