# Layer creation and media queries

This project shows how changing the size of your device or browser may change the layer order. In this example, we create the site layer only in wider browsers. We then assign styles to the page and site layers, in that order. In wide screens, the site layer is declared in the first line, meaning site has less precedence than page. Otherwise, site has precedence over page because it is declared later on narrow screens.
