    The overflow property - The overflow property helps you manage an element's 
    content overflow. Using this property, you can convey to a browser how it 
    should handle overflow content. The default value of the &lt;overflow&gt; 
    value type is visible. With this default setting, one can see content when 
    it overflows.

    To crop content when it overflows, you can set overflow: hidden. This does 
    exactly what it says: it hides overflow. Beware that this can make some 
    content invisible. You should only do this if hiding content won't cause 
    problems.">

        This box has a height and a width. This means that if there is too much 
        content to be displayed within the assigned height, there will be an 
        overflow situation. If overflow is set to hidden then any overflow will 
        not be visible.
