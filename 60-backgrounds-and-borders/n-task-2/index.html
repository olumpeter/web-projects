    In this task, we want you to add background images, a border, and some other 
    styling to a decorative box:
    1. Give the box a 5px lightblue border and round the top left corner 20px 
    and the bottom right corner 40px.
    1. The heading uses the star.png image as a background image, with a single 
    centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.
    1. Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it 
    is centered â€” you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons 
    to achieve this.">
