# Backgrounds and borders - Background attachment

Another option we have available for backgrounds is specifying how they scroll when the content scrolls. This is controlled using the <code>background-attachment</code> property, which can take the following values:

- <code>scroll</code>: causes the element's background to scroll when the page is scrolled. If the element content is scrolled, the background does not move. In effect, the background is fixed to the same position on the page, so it scrolls as the page scrolls.
- <code>fixed</code>: causes an element's background to be fixed to the viewport so that it doesn't scroll when the page or element content is scrolled. It will always remain in the same position on the screen.
- <code>local</code>: fixes the background to the element it is set on, so when you scroll the element, the background scrolls with it.
    
The <code>background-attachment</code> property only has an effect when there is content to scroll.
