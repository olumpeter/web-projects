    Position - The &lt;position&gt; value type represents a set of 2D coordinates, 
    used to position an item such as a background image (via background-position). 
    It can take keywords such as top, left, bottom, right, and center to align 
    items with specific bounds of a 2D box, along with lengths, which represent 
    offsets from the top and left-hand edges of the box.

    A typical position value consists of two values â€” the first sets the position 
    horizontally, the second vertically. If you only specify values for one axis 
    the other will default to center.
    
    In this project, we have positioned a background image 40px from the top and 
    to the right of the container using a keyword.">
