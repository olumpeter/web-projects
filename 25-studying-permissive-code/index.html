        <meta name="description" content="Studying permissive code: This web
        project is meant to study the permissive nature of HTML code. By 
        permissive, I mean that HTML is robust because it doesn't suffer from
        syntax error. This means that the page still displays even if there are 
        syntax errors in the HTML code.
        
        The code in this webpage is deliberately written with some built-in 
        errors for us to explore (the HTML markup is said to be badly-formed, 
        as opposed to well-formed)." />

        <p>Unclosed elements: What causes errors in HTML?

        <ul>
        <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,
            then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend

        <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
            for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</strong>
            what is this?</em>

        <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
            look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/>link to Mozilla
            homepage</a>
