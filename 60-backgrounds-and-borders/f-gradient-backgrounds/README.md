# Backgrounds and borders - Gradient backgrounds

A gradient — when used for a background — acts just like an image and is also set by using the background-image property. In this project, we try some different gradients. In the two boxes respectively, we have a linear gradient that is stretched over the whole box, and a radial gradient with a set size, which therefore repeats.
