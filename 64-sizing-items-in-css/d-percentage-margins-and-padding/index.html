    Percentage margins and padding - If you set margins and padding as a 
    percentage, you may notice some strange behavior. In this project we 
    have a box. We have given the inner box a margin of 10% and a padding 
    of 10%. The padding and margin on the top and bottom of the box are the 
    same size as the padding and margin on the left and right. 
    
    You might expect for example the percentage top and bottom margins to be 
    a percentage of the element's height, and the percentage left and right 
    margins to be a percentage of the element's width. However, this is not 
    the case!

    When you use margin and padding set in percentages, the value is 
    calculated from the inline size of the containing block â€” therefore the 
    width when working in a horizontal language. In our example, all of the 
    margins and padding are 10% of the width. This means you can have 
    equal-sized margins and padding all around the box. This is a fact 
    worth remembering if you do use percentages in this way.">
