# Sizing items in CSS: Using percentages

Percentages act like length units. When using a percentage you need to be aware what it is a percentage of. In the case of a box inside another container, if you give the child box a percentage <code>width</code> it will be a percentage of the <code>width</code> of the parent container.
    
This is because percentages resolve against the <code>size</code> of the containing block. With no percentage applied, our <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> would take up <code>100%</code> of the available space, as it is a block level element. If we give it a percentage <code>width</code>, this becomes a percentage of the space it would normally fill.
