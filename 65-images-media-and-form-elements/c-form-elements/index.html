    Form elements - Many form controls are added to your page by way of the 
    &lt;input&gt; element — this defines simple form fields such as text inputs, 
    through to more complex fields such as color and date pickers. There are some 
    additional elements, such as &lt;textarea&gt; for multiline text input, and 
    also elements used to contain and label parts of forms such as &lt;fieldset&gt; 
    and &lt;legend&gt;.
    
    HTML also contains attributes that enable web developers to indicate which 
    fields are required, and even the type of content that needs to be entered. 
    If the user enters something unexpected, or leaves a required field blank, 
    the browser can show an error message. Different browsers vary with one 
    another in how much styling and customization they allow for such items.
    
    In the example in this project, we have styled some text inputs using CSS — 
    you can see that things such as borders, margins and padding all apply as you 
    would expect. We are using attribute selectors to target the different input 
    types. Try changing how this form looks by adjusting the borders, adding 
    background colors to the fields, and changing fonts and padding.
    
    Warning: You should take care when changing the styling of form elements to 
    make sure it is still obvious to the user they are form elements. You could 
    create a form input with no borders and background that is almost 
    indistinguishable from the content around it, but this would make it very 
    hard to recognize and fill in.
    
    Inheritance and form elements: In some browsers, form elements do not inherit 
    font styling by default. Therefore, if you want to be sure that your form 
    fields use the font defined on the body, or on a parent element, you should 
    add this rule to your CSS.
    
    button,
    input,
    select,
    textarea {
      font-family: inherit;
      font-size: 100%;
    }
    
    Form elements and box-sizing: Across browsers, form elements use different 
    box sizing rules for different widgets. You learned about the box-sizing 
    property in our box model lesson and you can use this knowledge when styling 
    forms to ensure a consistent experience when setting widths and heights on 
    form elements.

    For consistency, it is a good idea to set margins and padding to 0 on all 
    elements, then add these back in when styling particular controls:
    
    button,
    input,
    select,
    textarea {
      box-sizing: border-box;
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
    }
    
    Other useful settings: In addition to the rules mentioned above, you should 
    also set overflow: auto on &lt;textarea&gt;s to stop IE showing a scrollbar 
    when there is no need for one:
    
    textarea {
      overflow: auto;
    }
    Putting it all together into a &quot;reset&quot;: 
    
    button,
    input,
    select,
    textarea {
      font-family: inherit;
      font-size: 100%;
      box-sizing: border-box;
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
    }

    textarea {
      overflow: auto;
    }">
