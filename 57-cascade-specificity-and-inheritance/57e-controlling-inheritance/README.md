# Controlling inheritance

CSS provides five special universal property values for controlling inheritance. Every CSS property accepts these values.
<dl>
  <code>inherit</code>
  <dd>
    Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element. Effectively, this &quot;turns on inheritance&quot; 
  </dd>
  <code>initial</code>
  <dd>
    Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that property.
  </dd>
  <code>revert</code>
  <dd>
    Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that property. This value acts like unset in many cases.
  </dd>
  <code>revert-layer</code>
  <dd>
    Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a previous cascade layer.
  </dd>
  <code>unset</code>
  <dd>
    Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.
  </dd>
