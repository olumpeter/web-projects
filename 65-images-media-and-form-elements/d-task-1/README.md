# Images, media, and form elements: Task 1

In this task, you have an image that is overflowing the box. We want the image to scale down to fit inside the box without any extra white space, but we do not mind if some part of the image is cropped.
    
You've been asked to make the image fill the box, retaining aspect ratio. It has been explained that it is ok if some parts of the image are therefore cropped. Using <code>object-fit: cover</code> is the correct choice, they also need to set the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> to <code>100%</code>;
