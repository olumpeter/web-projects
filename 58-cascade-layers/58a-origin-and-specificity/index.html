    there are two links. The first has no author styles applied, so only 
    user-agent styles are applied (and your personal user styles, if any). The 
    second has text-decoration and color set by author styles  even though the 
    selector in the author stylesheet has a specificity of 0-0-0. The reason why 
    author styles &quot;win&quot; is because when there are conflicting styles 
    from different origins, the rules from the origin with precedence are 
    applied, irrespective of the specificity in the origin that doesn't have 
    precedence.">
