    Logical margin, border, and padding properties - The margin-top property is 
    mapped to margin-block-start â€” this will always refer to the margin at the 
    start of the block dimension.

    The padding-left property maps to padding-inline-start, the padding that is 
    applied to the start of the inline direction. This will be where sentences 
    start in that writing mode. The border-bottom property maps to 
    border-block-end, which is the border at the end of the block dimension.
    
    You can see a comparison between physical and logical properties below.
    
    If you change the writing mode of the boxes by switching the writing-mode 
    property on .box to vertical-rl, you will see how the physical properties 
    stay tied to their physical direction, whereas the logical properties switch 
    with the writing mode.
    
    You can also see that the h2 has a black border-bottom. Can you work out how 
    to make that bottom border always go below the text in both writing modes?">
