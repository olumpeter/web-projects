# User-action pseudo classes

Some pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document in some way. These user-action pseudo-classes, sometimes referred to as dynamic pseudo-classes, act as if a class had been added to the element when the user interacts with it. Examples include <code>:hover</code> which only applies if the user moves their pointer over an element, typically a link and the <code>:focus</code> which only applies if the user focuses the element by clicking or using keyboard controls.
