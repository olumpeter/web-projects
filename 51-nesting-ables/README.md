# Nesting Tables

It is possible to nest a table inside another one, as long as you include the complete structure, including the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element. This is generally not really advised, as it makes the markup more confusing and less accessible to screen reader users, and in many cases you might as well just insert extra cells/rows/columns into the existing table. It is however sometimes necessary, for example if you want to import content easily from other sources.
