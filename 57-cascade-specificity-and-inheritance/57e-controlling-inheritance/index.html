    <meta name="description" content="Controlling inheritance: CSS provides five 
    special universal property values for controlling inheritance. Every CSS 
    property accepts these values. 1. inherit - Sets the property value applied 
    to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element. 
    Effectively, this &quot;turns on inheritance&quot; 1. initial - Sets the 
    property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that 
    property. 1. revert - Resets the property value applied to a selected element 
    to the browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that 
    property. This value acts like unset in many cases. 1. revert-layer - Resets the 
    property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a 
    previous cascade layer. 1. unset - Resets the property to its natural value, 
    which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, 
    otherwise it acts like initial.">
