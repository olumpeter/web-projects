    The natural or intrinsic size of things - HTML Elements have a natural 
    size, set before they are affected by any CSS. A straightforward example 
    is an image. An image file contains sizing information, described as its 
    intrinsic size. This size is determined by the image itself, not by any 
    formatting we happen to apply.
    
    If you place an image on a page and do not change its height or width, 
    either by using attributes on the &lt;img&gt; tag or else by CSS, it 
    will be displayed using that intrinsic size. We have given the image in 
    this project a border so that you can see the extent of its size as 
    defined in its file.
    
    An empty &lt;div&gt;, on the other hand, has no size of its own. If you 
    add a &lt;div&gt; to your HTML with no content, then give it a border as 
    we did with the image, you will see a line on the page. This is the 
    collapsed border on the element — there is no content to hold it open. 
    In the second example of this project, that border stretches to the 
    width of the container, because it is a block level element, a behavior 
    that should be starting to become familiar to you. It has no height 
    (or size in the block dimension) because there is no content.

    Try adding some text inside the empty &lt;div&gt; element. The border 
    now contains that text because the height of the element is defined by 
    the content. Therefore the size of this &lt;div&gt; in the block 
    dimension comes from the size of the content. Again, this is the 
    intrinsic size of the element — its size is defined by its content.">
