# CSS values and units: Numbers

Some value types accept **numbers**, without any **unit** added to them. An example of a property which accepts a unitless number is the <code>opacity</code> property, which controls the **opacity of an element (how transparent it is)**. This property accepts a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque).

In this project, try changing the value of <code>opacity</code> to various decimal values between 0 and 1 and see how the box and its contents become more or less opaque.
