    pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document 
    in some way. These user-action pseudo-classes, sometimes referred to as 
    dynamic pseudo-classes, act as if a class had been added to the element 
    when the user interacts with it. Examples include :hover which only applies 
    if the user moves their pointer over an element, typically a link and the 
    :focus which only applies if the user focuses the element by clicking or 
    using keyboard controls.">
