# CSS values and units: Math functions

When you are creating styles for a project, you will probably start off with numbers like <code>300px</code> for **lengths** or <code>200ms</code> for **durations**. If you want to have these values change based on other values, you will need to do some math. You could calculate the percentage of a value or add a number to another number, then update your CSS with the result.
    
CSS has support for Math functions, which allow us to perform calculations instead of relying on static values or doing the math in JavaScript. One of the most common math functions is <code>calc()</code> which lets you do operations like <code>addition</code>, <code>subtraction</code>, <code>multiplication</code>, and <code>division</code>.
