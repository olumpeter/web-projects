    Replaced elements in layout - When using various CSS layout techniques on 
    replaced elements, you may well find that they behave slightly differently 
    from other elements. For example, in a flex or grid layout elements are 
    stretched by default to fill the entire area. Images will not stretch, and 
    instead will be aligned to the start of the grid area or flex container.

    In this project, you can see this happening in the example below where we 
    have a two column, two row grid container, which has four items in it. All 
    of the &lt;div&gt; elements have a background color and stretch to fill the 
    row and column. The image, however, does not stretch.
    
    Just keep in mind that replaced elements, when they become part of a grid 
    or flex layout, have different default behaviors, essentially to avoid them 
    being stretched strangely by the layout.
    
    To force the image to stretch to fill the grid cell it is in, you'd have to 
    do something like the following:
    
    img {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
    }
    
    This would, however, stretch the image, so it's probably not what you'd want 
    to do.">
