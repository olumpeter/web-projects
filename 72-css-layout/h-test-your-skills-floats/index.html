      content="# CSS layout - Test your skills: Floats
      The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand floats in CSS 
      using the `float` and `clear` properties and values as well as other methods 
      for clearing floats. You will be working through three small tasks that use 
      different elements of the material you have just covered.

      ## Task 1

      In this task, you need to float the two elements with a class of `float1` and 
      `float2` left and right, respectively. The text should then appear between the 
      two boxes, as in the image below:

      This task covers understanding of the basic `float` property, and the values 
      `left` and `right`. The following should be all they need to do.

      ```
      .task-1 .float1 {
        float: left;
      }
      
      .task-1 .float2 {
        float: right;
      }
      ```

      ## Task 2

      In this task, the element with a class of `float` should be floated left. 
      Then we want the first line of text to display next to that element, but the 
      following line of text (which has a class of below) to display underneath it.

      Your final result should look like the image below:

      In task 2 we check that the student understands how to clear an element from 
      a floated item. They need to flow the item left, then add `clear: left` to the 
      class for the second paragraph.

      ```
      .task-2 .float {
        float: left;
      }
      
      .task-2 .below {
        clear: left;
      }
      ```

      ## Task 3

      In this task, we have a floated element. The box wrapping the float and text is 
      displaying behind the float. Use the most up-to-date method available to cause 
      the box background to extend to below the float, as in the image below:

      In the final task the student is asked to use the most up-to-date method of 
      clearing the box underneath the floated item. Therefore they should add 
      `display: flow-root` to the class for `.box`. Other methods might be to use 
      `overflow` or a clearfix hack, however the learning materials detail the 
      `flow-root` method as the modern way to achieve this.
