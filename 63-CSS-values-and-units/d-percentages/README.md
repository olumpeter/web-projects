# CSS values and units: Percentages

In a lot of cases, a **percentage** is treated in the same way as a **length**. The thing with percentages is that they are always set **relative** to some other value. For example, if you set an element's <code>font-size</code> as a percentage, it will be a percentage of the <code>font-size</code> of the element's parent. If you use a percentage for a <code>width value</code>, it will be a percentage of the width of the parent.
    
In this project, the two **percentage-sized** boxes and the two pixel-sized boxes have the same class names. The sets are <code>40%</code> and <code>200px</code> wide respectively. The difference is that the second set of two boxes is inside a wrapper that is <code>400px</code> wide. The second <code>200px</code> wide box is the same <code>width</code> as the first one, but the second 40% box is now <code>40%</code> of <code>400px</code> â€” a lot narrower than the first one!
    
The next example has font sizes set in percentages. Each <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> has a <code>font-size</code> of <code>80%;</code> therefore, the nested list items become progressively smaller as they inherit their sizing from their parent.
