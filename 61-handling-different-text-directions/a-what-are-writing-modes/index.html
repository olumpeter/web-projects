    writing modes - A writing mode in CSS refers to whether the text is running 
    horizontally or vertically. The writing-mode property lets us switch from one 
    writing mode to another.

    In this project, we have a heading displayed using writing-mode: vertical-rl. 
    The text now runs vertically. Vertical text is common in graphic design, and 
    can be a way to add a more interesting look and feel to your web design.
    
    The three possible values for the writing-mode property are:
    
    - horizontal-tb: Top-to-bottom block flow direction. Sentences run horizontally.
    - vertical-rl: Right-to-left block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.
    - vertical-lr: Left-to-right block flow direction. Sentences run vertically.">
