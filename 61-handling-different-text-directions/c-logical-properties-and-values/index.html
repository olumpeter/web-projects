    <meta name="description" content="Handling different text directions: 
    Writing modes and block and inline layout - Block and inline layout is 
    tied to the writing mode of the document, and not the physical screen. 
    Blocks are only displayed from the top to the bottom of the page if you are 
    using a writing mode that displays text horizontally, such as English.
    
    In this project, I have two boxes that contain a heading and a paragraph. 
    The first uses writing-mode: horizontal-tb, a writing mode that is written 
    horizontally and from the top of the page to the bottom. The second uses 
    writing-mode: vertical-rl; this is a writing mode that is written vertically 
    and from right to left.
    
    When we switch the writing mode, we are changing which direction is block 
    and which is inline. In a horizontal-tb writing mode the block direction 
    runs from top to bottom; in a vertical-rl writing mode the block direction 
    runs right-to-left horizontally. So the block dimension is always the 
    direction blocks are displayed on the page in the writing mode in use. The 
    inline dimension is always the direction a sentence flows.">
