    Where display: inline-block can be useful is when you want to give a link 
    a larger hit area by adding padding. &lt;a&gt; is an inline element like 
    &gt;span&gt;; you can use display: inline-block to allow padding to be 
    set on it, making it easier for a user to click the link.

    You see this fairly frequently in navigation bars. The navigation below 
    is displayed in a row using flexbox and we have added padding to the 
    &lt;a&gt; element as we want to be able to change the background-color 
    when the &lt;a&gt; is hovered. The padding appears to overlap the border 
    on the &lt;ul&gt; element. This is because the &lt;a&gt; is an inline 
    element.
    
    Add display: inline-block to the rule with the .links-list a selector, and 
    you will see how it fixes this issue by causing the padding to be respected 
    by other elements.">
