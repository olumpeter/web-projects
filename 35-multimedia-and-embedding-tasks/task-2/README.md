# Multimedia and embedding task 2

This task tests your ability to:

- put together a full-featured video player with multiple sources using <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements accompanied with the <code>controls</code> attribute to ensure you can easily play the audio, and a fallback text to be displayed in an event that the browser cannot play the video. 
- use <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element to add the multiple video sources so that you can support older browsers that don't support MP4 and instead support WebM.
- ensure that you specify the media type for each video by including the <code>type</code> attribute in each <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element. Use the &lt;track&gt; element to display subtitles, with appropriate <code>kind</code>, <code>src</code>, and <code>srclang</code> attributes.
- make the embedded video 320 by 240 using the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes
- make sure that no sound is played using the <code>muted</code> attribute.

Note that the subtitles will not load if you try to run the example locally, due to browser security policy. To see the subtitles you must run the example from an actual web server.
