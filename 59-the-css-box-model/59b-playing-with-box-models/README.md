# The CSS Box-model: Playing with box models

In this project you can see two boxes. Both have a class of <code>.box</code>, which gives them the same <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code>. The only difference is that the second box has been set to use the alternative box model. 

Can you change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the <code>.alternate</code> class) to make it match the first box in width and height?
