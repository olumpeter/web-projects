    <meta name="description" content="Table headers: To recognize the table 
    headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you can use the 
    &lt;th&gt; element (&quot;th&quot; stands for &quot;table header&quot;). 
    This works in exactly the same way as a &lt;td&gt;, except that it denotes 
    a header, not a normal cell. Table headers are useful because it is easier 
    to find the data you are looking for when the headers clearly stand out, and 
    the design just generally looks better. Note that Table headings come with 
    some default styling — they are bold and centered even if you don't add your 
    own styling to the table, to help them stand out. Tables headers also have an 
    added benefit — along with the scope attribute, they allow you to make tables 
    more accessible by associating each header with all the data in the same row 
    or column. Screen readers are then able to read out a whole row or column of 
    data at once, which is pretty useful. ">
