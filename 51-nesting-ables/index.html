    <meta name="description" content="Nesting Tables: It is possible to nest a 
    table inside another one, as long as you include the complete structure, 
    including the &lt;table&gt; element. This is generally not really advised, 
    as it makes the markup more confusing and less accessible to screen reader 
    users, and in many cases you might as well just insert extra 
    cells/rows/columns into the existing table. It is however sometimes necessary, 
    for example if you want to import content easily from other sources.">
