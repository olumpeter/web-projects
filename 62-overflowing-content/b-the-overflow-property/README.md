# Overflowing content: The overflow property

The <code>overflow</code> property helps you manage an element's content overflow. Using this property, you can convey to a browser how it should handle overflow content. The default value of the <code>&lt;overflow&gt;</code> value type is <code>visible</code>. With this default setting, one can see content when it overflows.

To crop content when it overflows, you can set <code>overflow: hidden</code>. This does exactly what it says: it hides overflow. Beware that this can make some 
content invisible. You should only do this if hiding content won't cause problems.
