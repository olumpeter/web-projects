    Task 2 - In this task, you have a box, which contains another box. 
    Your task is to make the inner box 60% of the width of the outer box. 
    The value of the box-sizing property is set to border-box, which means 
    that the total width includes any padding and border. You should also 
    give the inner box padding of 10% using the width (or inline size) as 
    the size from which that percentage is calculated.">
