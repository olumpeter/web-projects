    Logical values: There are also some properties that take physical values 
    of top, right, bottom, and left. These values also have mappings, to 
    logical values â€” block-start, inline-end, block-end, and inline-start.
    
    For example, you can float an image left to cause text to wrap round the 
    image. You could replace left with inline-start as shown in this project.
    
    Change the writing mode on this example to vertical-rl to see what happens 
    to the image. Change inline-start to inline-end to change the float.">
