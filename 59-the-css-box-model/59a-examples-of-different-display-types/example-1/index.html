      <!-- 
        A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as 
        a block box. The paragraph starts on a new line and extends the entire 
        available width. 
      -->
      <p>
        I am a paragraph. A short one.
      </p>

      <!-- 
        A list, which is laid out using display: flex. This establishes flex 
        layout for the children of the container, which are flex items. The 
        list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands to the 
        full container width and breaks onto a new line. 
      -->
      
      <ul>
        <li>Item One</li>
        <li>Item Two</li>
        <li>Item Three</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- 
        A block-level paragraph, inside which are two <span> elements. These 
        elements would normally be inline, however, one of the elements has a 
        class of "block" which gets set to display: block. 
      -->
      <p>
        I am another paragraph. Some of the <span class="block">words</span> 
        have been wrapped in a <span>span element</span>.
