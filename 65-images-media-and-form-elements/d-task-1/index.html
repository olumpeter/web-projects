    Task 1: In this task, you have an image that is overflowing the box. We want 
    the image to scale down to fit inside the box without any extra white space, 
    but we do not mind if some part of the image is cropped.
    
    You've been asked to make the image fill the box, retaining aspect ratio. 
    It has been explained that it is ok if some parts of the image are therefore 
    cropped. Using object-fit: cover is the correct choice, they also need to set 
    the width and height to 100%;">
