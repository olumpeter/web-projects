# Backgrounds and borders - Using the background shorthand property

There are a variety of styles that you can use for borders. In this project, we have used two different border styles for the box and two different border styles for the heading. 

Play with the border <code>style</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>color</code> to see how borders work.
