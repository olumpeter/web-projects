    Using hues to specify a color - If you want to go beyond keywords, hexadecimal, 
    and rgb() for colors, you might want to try using &lt;hue&gt;. Hue is the 
    property that allows us to tell the difference or similarity between colors 
    like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, etc. The key concept is that you can 
    specify a hue in an &lt;angle&gt; because most of the color models describe 
    hues using a color wheel. 
    
    A great starting point for using hues in CSS is the hsl() function. Let's take 
    a quick look at the parts you can specify:

    - Hue: The base shade of the color. This takes a &lt;hue&gt; value between 0 
    and 360, representing the angles around a color wheel.
    - Saturation: How saturated is the color? This takes a value from 0–100%, 
    where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and 100% is full 
    color saturation.
    - Lightness: How light or bright is the color? This takes a value from 0–100%, 
    where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100% is full light 
    (it will appear completely white).

    Similar to rgb(), the hsl() color value also has an optional fourth value, 
    separated from the color with a slash (/), representing the alpha transparency.">
