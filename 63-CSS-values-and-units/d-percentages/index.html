    Percentages - In a lot of cases, a percentage is treated in the same way 
    as a length. The thing with percentages is that they are always set relative 
    to some other value. For example, if you set an element's font-size as a 
    percentage, it will be a percentage of the font-size of the element's parent. 
    If you use a percentage for a width value, it will be a percentage of the 
    width of the parent.
    
    In this project, the two percentage-sized boxes and the two pixel-sized boxes 
    have the same class names. The sets are 40% and 200px wide respectively. The 
    difference is that the second set of two boxes is inside a wrapper that is 
    400px wide. The second 200px wide box is the same width as the first one, but 
    the second 40% box is now 40% of 400px â€” a lot narrower than the first one!
    
    The next example has font sizes set in percentages. Each &lt;li&gt; has a 
    font-size of 80%; therefore, the nested list items become progressively 
    smaller as they inherit their sizing from their parent.">
