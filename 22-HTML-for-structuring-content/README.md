# Marking up document and website structure

The aim of this project is to illustrate a typical website layout and structure, and how you can lay it out using CSS. The website layout and structure is implemented using the following semantic mark up: 
<ul>
  <li>header: &lt;header&gt;</li>
  <li>navigation bar: &lt;nav&gt;</li>
  <li>main content: &lt;main&gt;</li>
  <li>sidebar: &lt;aside&gt;</li>
  <li>footer: &lt;footer&gt;</li>
</ul>

The text in the article in the webpage was sourced from <a href="https://provenir.com.au/recipes/everything-you-need-to-know-about-osso-buco/"> provenir website </a> and its only meant for active learning and demonstration.
