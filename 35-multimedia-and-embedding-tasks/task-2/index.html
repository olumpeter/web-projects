    tests your ability to put together a full-featured video player with multiple 
    sources using &lt;video&gt; elements accompanied with the controls attribute 
    to ensure we cam easily play the audio, and a fallback text to be displayed 
    in an event that the browser cannot play the video. Use and &lt;source&gt; 
    to add the multiple video sources so that you can support older browsers that 
    don't support MP4 and instead support WebM. Ensure that you specify the media 
    type for each video by including the type attribute in each &lt;source&gt; 
    element. Use the &lt;track&gt; element to display subtitles, with appropriate 
    kind, src, and srclang attributes.  Also, make the embedded video 320 by 240 
    using the width and height attributes, make sure that no sound is played 
    using the muted attribute. Note that the subtitles will not load if you try 
    to run the example locally, due to browser security policy. To see the 
    subtitles you must run the example from an actual web server.">
