# Styling text: Typesetting a community school homepage

## Project brief

You've been provided with some raw HTML for the homepage of an imaginary 
community college, plus some CSS that styles the page into a three column 
layout and provides some other rudimentary styling. You're to write your 
CSS additions below the comment at the bottom of the CSS file to make sure 
it's easy to mark the bits you've done. Don't worry if some of the selectors 
are repetitious; we'll let you off in this instance.

### Fonts

- First of all, download a couple of free-to-use fonts. Because this is a 
college, the fonts should be chosen to give the page a fairly serious, 
formal, trustworthy feel: a serif site-wide font for the general body text, 
coupled with a sans-serif or slab serif for the headings might be nice.
- Use a suitable service to generate bulletproof @font-face code for these 
two fonts.
- Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your 
headings.

### General text styling

- Give the page a site-wide font-size of 10px.
- Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined 
using a suitable relative unit.
- Give your body text a suitable line-height.
- Center your top level heading on the page.
- Give your headings a little bit of letter-spacing to make them not too 
squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.
- Give your body text some letter-spacing and word-spacing, as appropriate.
- Give the first paragraph after each heading in the &lt;section&gt; a 
little bit of text-indentation, say 20px.

### Links:

- Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states some colors that go with 
the color of the horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.
- Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or 
focus them the underline disappears.
- Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.
- Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out 
nicely, but make it still fit in with the overall page design.
- Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next 
to them.

### Lists:

- Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the 
styling of the overall page. Each list item should have the same line-height 
as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top 
and bottom as you have between paragraphs.
- Give your list items a nice bullet appropriate for the design of the page. 
It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.

### Navigation menu:

- Style your navigation menu so that it harmonizes with the page.

## Hints and tips

- You don't need to edit the HTML in any way for this exercise.
- You don't necessarily have to make the nav menu look like buttons, but it 
needs to be a bit taller so that it doesn't look silly on the side of the 
page; also remember that you need to make this one a vertical nav menu.
