      content="# CSS layout - Positioning
      Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make 
      them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another or by 
      always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article 
      explains the different position values and how to use them.

      ## Introducing positioning

      Positioning allows us to produce interesting results by overriding normal 
      document flow. What if you want to slightly alter the position of some boxes 
      from their default flow position to give a slightly quirky, distressed feel? 
      Positioning is your tool. Or what if you want to create a UI element that 
      floats over the top of other parts of the page and/or always sits in the same 
      place inside the browser window no matter how much the page is scrolled? 
      Positioning makes such layout work possible.

      There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put into 
      effect on HTML elements. To make a specific type of positioning active on an 
      element, we use the `position` property.

      <h2>Basic document flow</h2>

      <p>
        I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on 
        new lines below me.
      </p>

      <p>
        By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height 
        is as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + 
        padding + border width/height.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are 
        separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on 
        the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on 
        the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if 
        possible â€” like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line 
        if not, much like this image will do: 
        <img src="long.jpg" alt="a wide but short section of a photo of several fabrics">
