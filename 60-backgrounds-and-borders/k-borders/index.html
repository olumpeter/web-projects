    In this project, we will look at how to use borders creatively. Typically 
    when we add borders to an element with CSS we use a shorthand property that 
    sets the color, width, and style of the border in one line of CSS.
    
    We can set a border for all four sides of a box with border. For instance: 
    border: 1px solid black;
    
    Or we can target one edge of the box, for instance: 
    border-top: 1px solid black;
    
    There are a variety of styles that you can use for borders. In this project, 
    we have used two different border styles for the box and two different border 
    styles for the heading. 
    
    Play with the border style, width, and color to see how borders work.">
