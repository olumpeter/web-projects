# Marking up a letter: 

This project helps you to actively learn text basic and advanced HTML text formatting, use of hyperlinks, and use of HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.  The following areas are covered:

## Block/structural semantics

This involves:
- structuring the overall document with an appropriate structure including <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements.
- marking up the letter with a structure of paragraphs and headings.
  - The "Re:" in the letter should be the only level one heading marked up using <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> HTML element.
  - The sections in the letter such as "Starting dates", "Subjects of study" and "Exotic dance moves" should be marked up as level 2 headers marked using <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> HTML element.
  - All appropriate structural elements that shouldn't be headings or lists should be marked up as paragraphs.
