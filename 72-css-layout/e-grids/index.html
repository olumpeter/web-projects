      content="# CSS layout - Grids
    CSS grid layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you 
    organize content into rows and columns and offers many features to simplify 
    the creation of complex layouts. This article will explain all you need to 
    know to get started with grid layout.

    ## What is grid layout?

    A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern 
    against which we can line up our design elements. They help us to create 
    layouts in which our elements won't jump around or change width as we move 
    from page to page, providing greater consistency on our websites.

    A grid will typically have **columns**, **rows**, and then gaps between each 
    row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as **gutters**.

    ## Creating your grid in CSS

    Having decided on the grid that your design needs, you can use CSS Grid 
    Layout to create it. We'll look at the basic features of Grid Layout first 
    and then explore how to create a simple grid system for your project.

    ## Defining a grid

    Let's try out grid layouts with the help of an example. 
    
    You will see an example with a container, which has some child items. By 
    default, these items are displayed in a normal flow, causing them to appear 
    one below the other. For the initial part of this lesson, we'll be using this 
    file to see how its grid behaves.

    Similar to how you define flexbox, you define a grid layout by setting the 
    value of the <code>display</code> property to grid. As in the case of flexbox, 
    the <code>display: grid</code> property transforms all the direct children of 
    the container into grid items. Add the following CSS to your file:

      ```
      .defining-a-grid .container {
        /* define a grid layout */
        display: grid;
      }      
      ```
    Unlike Flexbox, the items will not immediately look any different. Declaring 
    <code>display: grid</code> gives you a one column grid, so your items will 
    continue to display one below the other as they do in normal flow.

    To see something that looks more grid-like, we'll need to add some columns 
    to the grid. Let's add three 200-pixel columns. You can use any length unit or 
    percentage to create these column tracks.

      ```
      .defining-a-grid .container {
        /* define a grid layout */
        display: grid;

        /* add three 200-pixel columns */
        grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
      }
      
      ```
    Add the second declaration to your CSS rule, then reload the page. You should 
    see that the items have rearranged themselves such that there's one in each 
    cell of the grid.

    ## Flexible grids with the fr unit

    In addition to creating grids using lengths and percentages, we can use 
    <code>fr</code>. The <code>fr</code> unit represents one fraction of the 
    available space in the grid container to flexibly size grid rows and columns.

    Change your track listing to the following definition, creating three 
    <code>1fr</code> tracks:

      ```
      .flexible-grids-with-the-fr-unit .container{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
      }
      ```

    You now have flexible tracks. The fr unit distributes space proportionally. 
    You can specify different positive values for your tracks like so:

    
    ```
    .flexible-grids-with-the-fr-unit .container{
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
    }
    ```

    The first track gets <code>2fr</code> of the available space and the other 
    two tracks get <code>1fr</code>, making the first track larger. You can mix 
    <code>fr</code> units with fixed length units. In this case, the space needed 
    for the fixed tracks is used up first before the remaining space is distributed 
    to the other tracks.

    >**Note:** The `fr` unit distributes available space, not all space. Therefore, 
    if one of your tracks has something large inside it, there will be less free 
    space to share.

    ## Gaps between tracks

    To create gaps between tracks, we use the properties:

    - `column-gap` for gaps between columns
    - `row-gap` for gaps between rows
    - `gap` as a shorthand for both

      ```
      .gaps-between-tracks .container{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
        gap: 20px;
      }
      ```
    These gaps can be any length unit or percentage, but not an `fr` unit. 
    
    > **Note**: The gap properties (column-gap, row-gap and gap) used to be 
    prefixed by grid-. The spec has changed but the prefixed versions will be 
    maintained as an alias. To be on the safe side and make your code more 
    bulletproof, you can add both properties:

      ```
      .gaps-between-tracks .container{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
        gap: 20px;
        grid-gap: 20px;
      }
      ```
    ## Repeating track listings

    You can repeat all or merely a section of your track listing using the CSS 
    repeat() function. Change your track listing to the following:

      ```
      .repeating-track-listings .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        gap: 20px;
      }
      ```

    You'll now get three `1fr` tracks just as before. The first value passed to the 
    `repeat()` function specifies the number of times you want the listing to 
    repeat, while the second value is a track listing, which may be one or more 
    tracks that you want to repeat.
    
    ## Implicit and explicit grids

    Up to this point, we've specified only column tracks, but rows are automatically 
    created to hold the content. This concept highlights the distinction between 
    explicit and implicit grids. Here's a bit more about the difference between 
    the two types of grids:

      - **Explicit grid** is created using `grid-template-columns` or 
      `grid-template-rows.`
      - **Implicit grid** extends the defined explicit grid when content is 
      placed outside of that grid, such as into the rows by drawing additional 
      grid lines.
    
    By default, tracks created in the implicit grid are `auto` sized, which in 
    general means that they're large enough to contain their content. If you wish 
    to give implicit grid tracks a size, you can use the `grid-auto-rows` and 
    `grid-auto-columns` properties. If you add `grid-auto-rows` with a value of 
    `100px` to your CSS, you'll see that those created rows are now 100 pixels tall.

      ```
      .implicit-and-explicit-grids .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        grid-auto-rows: 100px;
        gap: 20px;
      }      
      ```

    ## The minmax() function

    Our 100-pixel tall tracks won't be very useful if we add content into those 
    tracks that is taller than 100 pixels, in which case it would cause an 
    overflow. It might be better to have tracks that are at least 100 pixels tall 
    and can still expand if more content becomes added. A fairly basic fact about 
    the web is that you never really know how tall something is going to be — 
    additional content or larger font sizes can cause problems with designs that 
    attempt to be pixel perfect in every dimension.

    The `minmax()` function lets us set a minimum and maximum size for a track, 
    for example, `minmax(100px, auto)`. The minimum size is 100 pixels, but the 
    maximum is `auto`, which will expand to accommodate more content. Try changing 
    `grid-auto-rows` to use a minmax value:

      ```
      .the_minmax_function .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
        gap: 20px;
      }
      ```

    ## As many columns as will fit

    We can combine some of the lessons we've learned about track listing, 
    repeat notation, and `minmax()` to create a useful pattern. Sometimes it's 
    helpful to be able to ask grid to create as many columns as will fit into the 
    container. We do this by setting the value of `grid-template-columns` using 
    the `repeat()` function, but instead of passing in a number, pass in the 
    keyword `auto-fit`. For the second parameter of the function we use `minmax()` 
    with a minimum value equal to the minimum track size that we would like to 
    have and a maximum of `1fr`.

    Try this in your file now using the CSS below:
      
      ```
      .as-many-columns-as-will-fit .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
        grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
        gap: 20px;
      }
      ```
    
    This works because grid is creating as many 200-pixel columns as will fit into 
    the container, then sharing whatever space is leftover among all the columns. The 
    maximum is `1fr` which, as we already know, distributes space evenly between tracks.
    
    ## Line-based placement

    We now move on from creating a grid to placing things on the grid. Our grid 
    always has lines — these are numbered beginning with 1 and relate to the 
    writing mode of the document. For example, column line 1 in English (written 
    left-to-right) would be on the left-hand side of the grid and row line 1 at 
    the top, while in Arabic (written right-to-left), column line 1 would be on 
    the right-hand side.

    To position items along these lines, we can specify the start and end lines 
    of the grid area where an item should be placed. There are four properties we 
    can use to do this:

      - `grid-column-start`
      - `grid-column-end`
      - `grid-row-start`
      - `grid-row-end`
    
    These properties accept line numbers as their values, so we can specify that 
    an item should start on line 1 and end on line 3, for example. Alternatively, 
    you can also use shorthand properties that let you specify the start and end 
    lines simultaneously, separated by a forward slash `/`:
      
      - `grid-column` shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end.
      - `grid-row` shorthand for grid-row-start and grid-row-end.
    
    Let's arrange all of the elements for our site by using the grid lines. Add 
    the following rules to the bottom of your CSS:

      ```
      .line-based-placement header {
        grid-column: 1 / 3;
        grid-row: 1;
      }
      
      .line-based-placement aside {
        grid-column: 1;
        grid-row: 2 / 4;
      }
      
      .line-based-placement article {
        grid-column: 2;
        grid-row: 2;
      }
      
      .line-based-placement footer {
        grid-column: 1 / 3;
        grid-row: 3;
      }
      ```

    ## Positioning with `grid-template-areas`

    An alternative way to arrange items on your grid is to use the 
    `grid-template-areas` property and give the various elements of your design 
    a name.

      ```
      .positioning-with-grid-template-areas .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
        gap: 20px;
      }

      .positioning-with-grid-template-areas .container {
        grid-template-areas: 
          &quot;header header&quot;
          &quot;aside article&quot;
          &quot;footer footer&quot;;
      }
      
      .positioning-with-grid-template-areas header {
        grid-area: header;
      }
      
      .positioning-with-grid-template-areas aside {
        grid-area: aside;
      }
      
      .positioning-with-grid-template-areas article {
        grid-area: article;
      }
      
      .positioning-with-grid-template-areas footer {
        grid-area: footer;
      }      
      ```
    The rules for `grid-template-areas` are as follows:

      - You need to have every cell of the grid filled.
      - To span across two cells, repeat the name.
      - To leave a cell empty, use a . (period).
      - Areas must be rectangular — for example, you can't have an L-shaped area.
      - Areas can't be repeated in different locations.
      - You can play around with our layout, changing the footer to only sit 
      underneath the article and the sidebar to span all the way down. This is a 
      very nice way to describe a layout because it's clear just from looking at 
      the CSS to know exactly what's happening.

    ## Nesting grids and subgrid

    It's possible to nest a grid within another grid, creating a &quot;subgrid&quot;. 
    You can do this by setting the display: grid property on a grid item.

    Let's expand on the previous example by adding a container for articles and 
    using a nested grid to control the layout of multiple articles. While we're 
    using only one column in the nested grid, we can define the rows to be split 
    in a 2:1:1 ratio by using the grid-template-rows property. This approach 
    allows us to create a layout where one article at the top of the page has a 
    large display, while the others have a smaller, preview-like layout.

      ```
      .nesting-grids-and-subgrid .articles {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
        gap: inherit;
      }
      
      .nesting-grids-and-subgrid article {
        padding: 10px;
        border: 2px solid rgb(79 185 227);
        border-radius: 5px;
      }
      
      ```
    
    - To make it easier to work with layouts in nested grids, you can use `subgrid` 
    on `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties. This allows you to leverage the tracks defined in the parent grid.

    - In the following example, we're using **line-based placement**, enabling 
    the nested grid to span multiple columns and rows of the parent grid. We've 
    added subgrid to inherit the parent grid's column tracks while adding a 
    different layout for the rows within the nested grid.

      ```
      .nesting-grids-and-subgrid-example-2 .container  {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
        grid-template-rows: repeat(1, 1fr);
        gap: 10px;
      }
      
      #subgrid {
        grid-column: 1 / 4;
        grid-row: 2 / 4;
        display: grid;
        gap: inherit;
        grid-template-columns: subgrid;
        grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr;
      }      
      ```
    
    ## Grid frameworks

    Numerous grid frameworks are available, offering a 12 or 16-column grid, 
    to help with laying out your content. The good news is that you probably 
    won't need any third-party frameworks to help you create grid-based 
    layouts — grid functionality is already included in the specification and is 
    supported by most modern browsers.

      ```
      .grid-frameworks .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0,1fr));
        gap: 20px;
      }
      
      .grid-frameworks header {
        grid-row: 1;
        grid-column: 1 / 13;
      }
      
      .grid-frameworks aside {
        grid-row: 2;
        grid-column: 1 / 4;
      }
      
      .grid-frameworks article {
        grid-row: 2;
        grid-column: 4 / 13;
      }
      
      .grid-frameworks footer {
        grid-row: 3;
        grid-column: 1 / 13;
      }
      ```
    This has a container with a 12-column grid defined and the same markup we 
    used in the previous two examples. We can now use line-based placement to 
    place our content on the 12-column grid.

    If you use the Firefox Grid Inspector to overlay the grid lines on your 
    design, you can see how our 12-column grid works.
