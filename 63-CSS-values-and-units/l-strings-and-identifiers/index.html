    Strings and identifiers - We've seen places where keywords are used as a 
    value (for example &lt;color&gt; keywords like red, black, rebeccapurple, 
    and goldenrod). These keywords are more accurately described as identifiers, 
    a special value that CSS understands. As such they are not quoted â€” they are 
    not treated as strings.

    There are places where you use strings in CSS. For example, when specifying 
    generated content. In this case, the value is quoted to demonstrate that it 
    is a string. 
    
    In this project, we use unquoted color keywords along with a quoted generated 
    content string.">
