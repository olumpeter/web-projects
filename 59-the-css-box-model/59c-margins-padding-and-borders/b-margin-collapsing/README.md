# The CSS Box-model: Margins, padding, and borders - Margin collapsing

In this project, you have two paragraphs. The top paragraph has a <code>margin-bottom</code> of <code>50px</code>, the other has a <code>margin-top</code> of <code>30px</code>. The margins have collapsed together so the actual margin between the boxes is <code>50px</code> and not the total of the two margins.

You can test this by setting the <code>margin-top</code> of paragraph two to <code>0</code>. The visible margin between the two paragraphs will not change — it retains the <code>50px</code> set in the <code>margin-bottom</code> of paragraph one. If you set it to <code>-10px</code>, you'll see that the overall margin becomes <code>40px</code> — it subtracts from the <code>50px</code>.
