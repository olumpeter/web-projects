# Sizing items in CSS: Task 3

In this task, you have two images in boxes. One image is smaller than the box, the other is larger and breaking out of the box. If you imagine that the box is responsive and therefore could grow and shrink, which property would you apply to the image so that the large image shrinks down into the box but the small image does not stretch.

You need to use <code>max-width</code> set to <code>100%</code> to cause the larger image to grow only as large as the box. If you use <code>width: 100%</code> then the small image will stretch.
