# Using of &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;u&gt; to format HTML text

The &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;u&gt; HTML elements which format HTML text to be bold, italics, and underlined respectively are <b>presentational elements</b> rather than <b>semantic elements</b>.

This projects demonstrates:
<ul>
  <li>How &lt;i&gt; is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by italic: foreign words, taxonomic designation, technical terms, a thought…</li>
  <li>How &lt;b&gt;is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by bold: keywords, product names, lead sentence…</li>
  <li>How &lt;u&gt; is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by underline: proper name, misspelling…</li>
</ul>
