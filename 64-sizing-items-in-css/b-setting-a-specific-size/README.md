# Sizing items in CSS: Setting a specific size

We can, of course, give elements in our design a specific <code>size</code>. When a <code>size</code> is given to an element (the content of which then needs to fit into that <code>size</code>) we refer to it as an **extrinsic size**. Take our <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> from the previous project â€” we can give it specific <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values, and it will now have that <code>size</code> no matter what content is placed into it. As we discovered in our previous project on overflow, a set <code>height</code> can cause content to overflow if there is more content than the element has space to fit inside it.
    
Due to this problem of overflow, fixing the <code>height</code> of elements with <code>lengths</code> or <code>percentages</code> is something we need to do very carefully on the web.
