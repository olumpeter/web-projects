    images: The background-image property enables the display of an image in 
    the background of an element. In this project, we have two boxes â€” one 
    has a background image which is larger than the box (balloons.jpg), the 
    other has a small image of a single star (star.png).
    
    This project demonstrates that by default, the large image is not scaled 
    down to fit the box, so we only see a small corner of it, whereas the 
    small image is tiled to fill the box.
    
    If you specify a background color in addition to a background image then 
    the image displays on top of the color. Try adding a background-color 
    property to the example above to see that in action.">
