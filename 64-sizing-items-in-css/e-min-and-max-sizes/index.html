    min- and max- sizes: In addition to giving things a fixed size, we can 
    ask CSS to give an element a minimum or a maximum size. If you have a 
    box that might contain a variable amount of content, and you always want 
    it to be at least a certain height, you could set the min-height property 
    on it. The box will always be at least this height, but will then grow 
    taller if there is more content than the box has space for at its 
    minimum height.

    In this project, you can see two boxes, both with a defined min-height 
    of 150 pixels. The box on the left is 150 pixels tall; the box on the 
    right has content that needs more room, and so it has grown taller 
    than 150 pixels.
    
    This is very useful for dealing with variable amounts of content while 
    avoiding overflow.
    
    A common use of max-width is to cause images to scale down if there is 
    not enough space to display them at their intrinsic width while making 
    sure they don't become larger than that width. 
    
    As an example, if you were to set width: 100% on an image, and its 
    intrinsic width was smaller than its container, the image would be 
    forced to stretch and become larger, causing it to look pixelated.
    
    If you instead use max-width: 100%, and its intrinsic width is smaller 
    than its container, the image will not be forced to stretch and become 
    larger, thus preventing pixelation.
    
    In the second example in this project, we have used the same image three 
    times. The first image has been given width: 100% and is in a container 
    which is larger than it, therefore it stretches to the container width. 
    The second image has max-width: 100% set on it and therefore does not 
    stretch to fill the container. The third box contains the same image 
    again, also with max-width: 100% set; in this case you can see how it 
    has scaled down to fit into the box.
    
    This technique is used to make images responsive, so that when viewed 
    on a smaller device they scale down appropriately. You should, however, 
    not use this technique to load really large images and then scale them 
    down in the browser. Images should be appropriately sized to be no 
    larger than they need to be for the largest size they are displayed in 
    the design. Downloading overly large images will cause your site to 
    become slow, and it can cost users more money if they are on a metered 
    connection.">

          These boxes both have a min-height set, this box has content in 
          it which will need more space than the assigned height, and so 
          it grows from the minimum.
