# Overflowing content: Using <code>overflow: auto</code>

If you only want scrollbars to appear when there is more content than can fit in the box, use <code>overflow: auto</code>. This allows the browser to determine if it should display scrollbars.
    
In this project, remove content until it fits into the box. You should see the scrollbars disappear.
