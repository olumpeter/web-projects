    attachment: Another option we have available for backgrounds is 
    specifying how they scroll when the content scrolls. This is controlled 
    using the background-attachment property, which can take the following 
    values:

    - scroll: causes the element's background to scroll when the page is 
    scrolled. If the element content is scrolled, the background does not 
    move. In effect, the background is fixed to the same position on the 
    page, so it scrolls as the page scrolls.
    - fixed: causes an element's background to be fixed to the viewport so 
    that it doesn't scroll when the page or element content is scrolled. It 
    will always remain in the same position on the screen.
    - local: fixes the background to the element it is set on, so when you 
    scroll the element, the background scrolls with it.
    
    The background-attachment property only has an effect when there is 
    content to scroll.">

          <code>background-attachment: scroll</code> causes the element's 
          background to be fixed to the page, so that it scrolls when the 
          page is scrolled. If the element content is scrolled, the 
          background does not move.

          <code>background-attachment: local</code>, new to CSS3, causes 
          an element's background to be fixed to the actual element itself. 
          So When the page is scrolled, the element's background will move 
          along with it only if the element does so (so not in the case of 
          elements with <code>position: fixed</code>.) When the element's 
          content is scrolled, the background will scroll along with it.
