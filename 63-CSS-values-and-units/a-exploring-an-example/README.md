# CSS values and units: Exploring an example

In this project, you can see how some **relative** and **absolute** length units behave. 

The first box has a <code>width set in **pixels**</code>. As an **absolute** unit, this <code>width</code> will remain the same no matter what else changes. 
    
The second box has a <code>width</code> set in <code>vw</code> (**viewport width**) units. This value is relative to the **viewport width**, and so <code>10vw</code> is 10 percent of the **width of the viewport**. If you change the width of your browser window, the size of the box should change.
    
The third box uses <code>em</code> units. These are relative to the font size. I've set a font size of <code>1em</code> on the containing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, which has a class of <code>.wrapper</code>. Change this value to <code>1.5em</code> and you will see that the font size of all the elements increases, but only the last item will get wider, as its width is relative to that font size.
