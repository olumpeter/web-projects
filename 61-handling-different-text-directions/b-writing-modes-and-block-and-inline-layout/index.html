    Logical properties and values -  CSS has recently developed a set of mapped 
    properties. These essentially replace physical properties — things like 
    width and height — with logical, or flow relative versions.

    The property mapped to width when in a horizontal writing mode is called 
    inline-size — it refers to the size in the inline dimension. The property 
    for height is named block-size and is the size in the block dimension. In 
    this project, you can see how this works where we have replaced width with 
    inline-size.">
