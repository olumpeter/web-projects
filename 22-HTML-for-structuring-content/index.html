                <h2>Everything You Need to Know About Osso Buco</h2>

                <p>
                    There’s nothing more comforting on a cold winter’s day than 
                    enjoying a hearty braised dish. Osso buco is a tender and 
                    delicious dish that originates from northern Italy. As a 
                    delectable example of traditional Lombard cuisine, this 
                    specialty dish combines cross-cut veal shanks with vegetables, 
                    white wine, and broth. The defining feature of osso buco is 
                    the large bone and rich marrow centre, with this prized 
                    delicacy ideal for slow cooking and paddock-to-plate eating. 
                    Osso buco is a delicious and luxurious meal that’s perfect for 
                    winter nights and long meals with the people you love. 
                </p>

                <h3>A short history of osso buco</h3>

                <p>
                    Osso buco, or ossobuco as it’s sometimes written, literally 
                    means “bone with a hole”. While the early history of this 
                    dish is uncertain, it’s thought to have originated in Lombardy 
                    during the early 19th century. It wasn’t included in Italian 
                    cookbooks until much later, however, becoming famous beyond 
                    its homeland when it traveled with emigrants to the new world. 
                    This much-loved dish caught the world’s attention when it was 
                    included in recipe books outside Italy, including Art Culinaire 
                    Moderne by Henri-Paul Pellaprat and Italian Food by Elizabeth 
                    David.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Osso buco is the perfect combination of simplicity and luxury. 
                    While it may have a relatively low cost and involve very little 
                    preparation, you get to enjoy a tender and comfortable culinary 
                    experience. It was originally a seasonal dish to be enjoyed in 
                    winter, warming the household and boosting the mood of everyone 
                    within smelling distance. Osso buco has been through many changes 
                    over the years, with lemons and tomatoes added to some recipes 
                    and global variations adding flavours from Asia, the Americas, 
                    and beyond.

                <h3>The nutritional benefits of slow cooking</h3>

                <p>
                    Osso buco should always be enjoyed slowly. It takes a while for 
                    the delicious flavours to emerge from this cut, with patience 
                    leading to maximum tenderness and taste. Slow cooking also 
                    offers a number of nutritional benefits, especially when you 
                    include bones. The nutrients in red meat remain more stable 
                    when cooked slowly, and they’re also more likely to be 
                    reabsorbed as the meat changes form over time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you cook meat in a liquid at low heat, you can reduce the 
                    number of cell-damaging compounds known as AGEs (advanced 
                    glycation end products). This offers a number of health 
                    benefits, with AGEs linked with inflammation, diabetes, 
                    kidney disease, and even Alzheimer’s. Cooking slowly also 
                    leads to more tender results, and as a bonus, it helps to 
                    improve yields as meat shrinks less. When you cook slowly with 
                    bones, you get access to extra nutrients. The bones in 
                    osso buco meat are full of vital micronutrients, including 
                    calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and magnesium.
