# CSS layout - Positioning: Static positioning

Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means 
&quot;put the element into its normal position in the document flow — nothing 
special to see here.&quot;

To see this (and get your example set up for future sections) first add a class 
of positioned to the second `&lt;p&gt;` in the HTML:

Now add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:

```
.positioned {
  position: static;
  background: yellow;
}
```

If you save and refresh, you'll see no difference at all, except for the 
updated background color of the 2nd paragraph. This is fine — as we said 
before, static positioning is the default behavior!
