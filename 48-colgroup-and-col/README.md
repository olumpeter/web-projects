<code>&lt;colgroup&gt;<code> and <code>&lt;col&gt;<code> elements

This project will help you actively learn how to mark up HTML Tables. It expects you to mark up a timetable of a languages teacher. On Friday she has a new class teaching Dutch all day, but she also teaches German for a few periods on Tuesday and Thursdays. She wants to highlight the columns containing the days she is teaching. The <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code> element is normally added at the top of the table, just underneath the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag. The <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> element is normally added inside the <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code> element. To add a background-color to a column, value for your <code>style</code> attribute for Monday and Thursday is <code>background-color:#DCC48E;</code> while that for Tuesday and Friday is <code>background-color: 97DB9A;</code>. You need to style the column for Saturday and Sunday to have the value of the 
<code>width</code> attribute as <code>42px</code>.
