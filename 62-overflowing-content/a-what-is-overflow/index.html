    CSS tries to avoid &quot;data loss&quot; - Everything in CSS is a box. 
    You can constrain the size of these boxes by assigning values of width 
    and height (or inline-size and block-size). Overflow happens when there is 
    too much content to fit in a box. CSS provides various tools to manage 
    overflow.
    
    This example shows how you CSS tries to avoid &quot;data loss&quot;">

    <body>
      <div class="box">
        This box has a height and a width. This means that if there is too 
        much content to be displayed within the assigned height, there will 
        be an overflow situation. If overflow is set to hidden then any overflow 
        will not be visible.
      </div>

      <p>
        This content is outside of the box.
