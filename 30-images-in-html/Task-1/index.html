    simple image on the page using &lt;img&gt; element, give it some alternative 
    text using alt attribute, and give it some width and height attributes. It 
    also test your ability of using relative image paths. The alt text should 
    describe the visual appearance of image for those that can't see it. Finally, 
    the width and height attributes should contain the same values as the 
    image's intrinsic width and height, so it displays at the correct size.">
