    Task 1 - In this task, you have two boxes. 
    
    The first should be sized so that the height will be at least 100 pixels 
    tall, even if there is less content that would cause it to grow to that 
    height. However, the content should not overflow if there is more 
    content than fits in 100 pixels. Test this box by removing the content 
    from the HTML to make sure you still get a 100 pixel tall box even with 
    no content.

    The second box should be fixed at 100 pixels tall, so that content 
    will overflow if there is too much.">
