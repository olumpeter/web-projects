    specificity a selector has is measured using three different values 
    (or components), which can be thought of as ID, CLASS, and ELEMENT columns in 
    the hundreds, tens, and ones place:
    - Identifiers: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside 
    the overall selector.
    - Classes: Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute 
    selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.
    - Elements: Score one in this column for each element selector or 
    pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.">
