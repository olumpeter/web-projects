    ## Using an online font service

    Online font services generally store and serve fonts for you so you don't 
    have to worry about writing the @font-face code. Instead, you generally just 
    need to insert a simple line or two of code into your site to make everything 
    work. Examples include Adobe Fonts and Cloud.typography. Most of these services 
    are subscription-based, with the notable exception of Google Fonts, a useful 
    free service, especially for rapid testing work and writing demos.

    Most of these services are easy to use, so we won't cover them in great detail. 
    Let's have a quick look at Google Fonts so you can get the idea. 

    1. Go to **Google Fonts**.
    1. Search for your favorite fonts or use the filters at the top of the page 
    to display the kinds of fonts you want to choose and select a couple of fonts 
    that you like.
    1. To select a font family, click on the font preview and press the âŠ• button 
    alongside the font.
    1. When you've chosen the font families, press the View your selected families 
    button in the top right corner of the page.
    1. In the resulting screen, you first need to copy the line of HTML code shown 
    and paste it into the head of your HTML file. Put it above the existing 
    <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, so that the font is imported before you try 
    to use it in your CSS.
    1. You then need to copy the CSS declarations listed into your CSS as appropriate, 
    to apply the custom fonts to your HTML.
