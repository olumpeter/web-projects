      ## Relative positioning

      Relative positioning is the first position type we'll take a look at. This is 
      very similar to static positioning, except that once the positioned element 
      has taken its place in the normal flow, you can then modify its final position, 
      including making it overlap other elements on the page. Go ahead and update the 
      position declaration in your code:

      ```
      position: relative;
      ```

      If you save and refresh at this stage, you won't see a change in the result at 
      all. So how do you modify the element's position? You need to use the `top`, 
      `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties, which we'll explain in the next 
      section.

      ### Introducing `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`

      `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are used alongside position to specify 
      exactly where to move the positioned element to. To try this out, add the 
      following declarations to the .positioned rule in your CSS:

      ```
      top: 30px;
      left: 30px;
      ```

      Note: The values of these properties can take any units you'd reasonably 
      expect: pixels, mm, rems, %, etc.

      If you now save and refresh, you'll get a result something like this:

      Cool, huh? Ok, so this probably wasn't what you were expecting. Why has it 
      moved to the bottom and to the right if we specified top and left? This may 
      seem counterintuitive. You need to think of it as if there's an invisible 
      force that pushes the specified side of the positioned box, moving it in the 
      opposite direction. So, for example, if you specify top: 30px;, it's as if a 
      force will push the top of the box, causing it to move downwards by 30px.

        I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on 
        new lines below me.

      <p class="positioned ">
        By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height 
        is as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + 
        padding + border width/height.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are 
        separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on 
        the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on 
        the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if 
        possible â€” like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line 
        if not, much like this image will do: 
        <img src="long.jpg" alt="a wide but short section of a photo of several fabrics">
