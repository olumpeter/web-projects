            Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, 
            but determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and 
            prepared to do battle, hoping that his distress call had made it 
            through.

            Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty 
            statement and pondering when the next spin off series would 
            come out, when an enchanted distress letter flew through his 
            window and landed in his lap. He read it hazily and sighed; 
            "better get back to work then", he mused.
