# CSS values and units: <code>ems</code> and <code>rems</code>

<code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> are the two **relative lengths** you are likely to encounter most frequently when sizing anything from boxes to text. This project provides a demonstration. We have two lists in total and both examples have the same HTML. The only difference is that the first has a class of ems and the second a class of rems.
    
To start with, we set <code>16px</code> as the **font size** on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. The <code>em</code> unit means _&quot;my parent element's font-size&quot;_ in the case of typography.
    
The <code>rem</code> unit means _&quot;The root element's font-size&quot;_ (<code>rem</code> stands for _&quot;root em&quot;)_
