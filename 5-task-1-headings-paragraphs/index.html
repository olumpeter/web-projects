      <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>
      <p>
        This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.
      </p>

      <h2>The Llama</h2>
      <p>
        Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them 
        on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she 
        goes.
      </p>

      <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
      <p>
        The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, traveling 
        rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
