    one class applied: You can apply multiple classes to an element and target 
    them individually, or only select the element when all of the classes in 
    the selector are present. This can be helpful when building up components 
    that can be combined in different ways on your site. We can tell the browser 
    that we only want to match the element if it has two classes applied by 
    chaining them together with no white space between them.">
