# Adding a caption to a table using the <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element

The <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element is normally nested inside the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element. The caption is meant to contain a description of the table contents. This is useful for all readers wishing to get a quick idea of whether the table is useful to them as they scan the page, but particularly for blind users. Rather than have a screen reader read out the contents of many cells just to find out what the table is about, the user can rely on a caption and then decide whether or not to read the table in greater detail. A caption is placed directly beneath the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag.
