# CSS layout - Responsive design: A simple flexbox-based responsive design

In Flexbox, flex items shrink or grow, distributing space between the items 
according to the space in their container. By changing the values for 
`flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` you can indicate how you want the items to 
behave when they encounter more or less space around them. 

In the example below the flex items will each take an equal amount of space 
in the flex container, using the shorthand of `flex: 1` as described in the 
layout topic [Flexbox: Flexible sizing of flex items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox#flexible_sizing_of_flex_items).
