# Target an element if it has more than one class applied

You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them individually, or only select the element when all of the classes in the selector are present. This can be helpful when building up components that can be combined in different ways on your site. We can tell the browser that we only want to match the element if it has two classes applied by chaining them together with no white space between them.
