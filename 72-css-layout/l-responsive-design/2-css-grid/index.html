      ## A simple grid-based responsive design

      In CSS Grid Layout the `fr` unit allows the distribution of available space 
      across grid tracks. The next example creates a grid container with three tracks 
      sized at 1fr. This will create three column tracks, each taking one part of the 
      available space in the container. You can find out more about this approach to 
      create a grid in the Learn Layout Grids topic, under 
      [Flexible grids with the fr unit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids#flexible_grids_with_the_fr_unit).
      
      ```
      .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
      }
      ```
      ">

          One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers
          sat over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay,
          watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide
          chimney. Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were
          papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds
          and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
          millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires
          without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”
