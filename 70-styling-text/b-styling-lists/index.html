    Styling lists -  We'll look at unordered, ordered, and description lists — 
    all have styling features that are similar, as well as some that are 
    particular to themselves. 

    Here are some of the default styles applied to elements before you 
    explicitly specify author styles using CSS.
      - The &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; elements have a top and bottom margin 
      of 16px (1em) and a padding-left of 40px (2.5em). If the directionality 
      attribute dir is set to right-to-left (rtl) for ul and ol elements, in 
      that case padding-right comes into effect and its default value is 
      40px (2.5em).
      - The list items (&lt;li&gt; elements) have no set defaults for spacing.
      - The &lt;dl&gt; element has a top and bottom margin of 16px (1em), but 
      no padding set.
      - The &lt;dd&gt; elements have margin-left of 40px (2.5em).
      - The &lt;p&lt; elements we've included for reference have a top and 
      bottom margin of 16px (1em) — the same as the different list types.

    Handling list spacing

    When styling lists, you need to adjust their styles so they keep the 
    same vertical spacing as their surrounding elements (such as paragraphs 
    and images; sometimes called vertical rhythm), and the same horizontal 
    spacing as each other.

    The CSS used for the text styling and spacing is as follows:

    ```
    /* General styles */

    /* Rule 1 sets a sitewide font and a baseline font size of 10px. These are inherited 
    by everything on the page. */
    
    html {
      font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      font-size: 10px;
    }
    
    /* Rules 2 and 3 set relative font sizes for the headings, different list 
    types (the children of the list elements inherit these), and paragraphs. 
    This means that each paragraph and list will have the same font size and 
    top and bottom spacing, helping to keep the vertical rhythm consistent. */
    
    h2 {
      font-size: 2rem;
    }
    
    ul, 
    ol, 
    dl, 
    p {
      font-size: 1.5rem;
    }
    
    /* Rule 4 sets the same line-height on the paragraphs and list items — so the 
    paragraphs and each individual list item will have the same spacing between 
    lines. This will also help to keep the vertical rhythm consistent. */
    
    li, 
    p {
      line-height: 1.5;
    }
    
    /* Description list styles */
    
    /* Rules 5 and 6 apply to the description list. We set the same line-height 
    on the description list terms and descriptions as we did with the paragraphs 
    and list items. Again, consistency is good! We also make the description 
    terms have bold font, so they visually stand out easier. */
    
    dd, dt {
      line-height: 1.5;
    }
    
    dt {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```

    List-specific styles

    There are three properties you should know about to start with, which 
    can be set on &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; elements:

    - list-style-type: Sets the type of bullets to use for the list, for 
    example, square or circle bullets for an unordered list, or numbers, 
    letters, or roman numerals for an ordered list.
    - list-style-position: Sets whether the bullets, at the start of each 
    item, appear inside or outside the lists.
    - list-style-image: Allows you to use a custom image for the bullet, 
    rather than a simple square or circle.

    Bullet styles
    
    The list-style-type property allows you to set what type of bullet to 
    use for the bullet points. For example,

    ```
    /* Ordered list styles */

    ol {
      list-style-type: upper-roman;
    }
    ```

    Bullet position

    The list-style-position property sets whether the bullets appear inside 
    the list items, or outside them before the start of each item. The 
    default value is outside, which causes the bullets to sit outside the 
    list items, as seen in this project. You can try this as an example,

    ```
    ol {
      list-style-type: upper-roman;
      list-style-position: inside;
    }
    ```
    
    Using a custom bullet image

    The list-style-image property allows you to use a custom image for your 
    bullet. The syntax is pretty simple:

    ```
    ul {
      list-style-image: url(../images/star.svg);
    }    
    ```

    In this project, we did more:

    ```
    /* Unordered list styles */

    ul {
      padding-left: 2rem;
      list-style-type: none;
    }

    ul li {
      padding-left: 2rem;
      background-image: url(../images/star.svg);
      background-position: 0 0;
      background-size: 1.6rem 1.6rem;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
    }
    ```

    - padding-left: 2rem; set the padding-left of the &lt;ul&gt; down from 
    the default 40px to 20px, then set the same amount on the list items. 
    This is so that, overall, the list items are still lined up with the 
    ordered list items and the description list descriptions, but the list 
    items have some padding for the background images to sit inside. If we 
    didn't do this, the background images would overlap with the list item 
    text, which would look messy.
    - list-style-type: none; set the list-style-type to none, so that no 
    bullet appears by default. We're going to use background properties to 
    handle the bullets instead.
    - ul li selects each list item in the unordered list so that we can 
    insert a bullet onto each unordered list item.
      - background-image: This references the path to the image file you 
      want to use as the bullet.
      - background-position: This defines where in the background of the 
      selected element the image will appear — in this case we are saying 0 0, 
      which means the bullet will appear in the very top left of each list item.
      - background-size: This sets the size of the background image. We ideally 
      want the bullets to be the same size as the list items (or very slightly 
      smaller or larger). We are using a size of 1.6rem (16px), which fits very 
      nicely with the 20px padding we've allowed for the bullet to sit inside 
      — 16px plus 4px of space between the bullet and the list item text works 
      well.
      - background-repeat: By default, background images repeat until they fill 
      up the available background space. We only want one copy of the image 
      inserted in each case, so we set this to a value of no-repeat.

    Controlling list counting
    Sometimes you might want to count differently on an ordered list — e.g., 
    starting from a number other than 1, or counting backwards, or counting 
    in steps of more than 1. HTML and CSS have some tools to help you here.

    start
     
    The start attribute allows you to start the list counting from a number 
    other than 1. for example: &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

    reversed
    
    The reversed attribute will start the list counting down instead of up. 
    For example:  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot; reversed&gt;
    
    value
    
    The value attribute allows you to set your list items to specific 
    numerical values. The following example: &lt;li value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;,
    &lt;li value=&quot;4&quot;&gt;, &lt;li value=&quot;6&quot;&gt;, 
    &lt;li value=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
    ">
