      content="# CSS layout - Flexbox
      **Flexbox** is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows 
      or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit 
      into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.

      ## Why Flexbox?

      For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available 
      for creating CSS layouts were features like **floats** and **positioning**. 
      These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.

      The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to 
      achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:

        - Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
        - Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the 
        available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
        - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height 
        even if they contain a different amount of content.

      As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks 
      much easier. Let's dig in! 
      
      ## Introducing a simple example

      In this article, you'll work through a series of exercises to help you 
      understand how flexbox works. 

      You'll see that we have a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element with a top 
      level heading inside it and a <code>&lt;section</code>&gt; element containing 
      three <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s. We're going to use these to create a 
      fairly standard three column layout.
      
      ## Specifying what elements to lay out as flexible boxes

      To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid out as 
      flexible boxes. To do this, we set a special value of display on the parent 
      element of the elements you want to affect. In this case we want to lay out 
      the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements, so we set this on the 
      <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>:

        ```
        section {
          display: flex;
        }
        ```

      This causes the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element to become a flex 
      container and its children become flex items.

      This single declaration gives us everything we need. Incredible, right? We 
      have a multiple column layout with equal-sized columns, and the columns are 
      all the same height. This is because the default values given to flex items 
      (the children of the flex container) are set up to solve common problems 
      such as this.

      Let's recap what's happening here. Adding a display value of flex to an 
      element makes it a flex container. The container is displayed as Block-level 
      content in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page. When the 
      element is converted to a flex container, its children are converted to 
      (and laid out as) flex items.

      You can make the container inline using an **outside <code>display</code> 
      value** (e.g., <code>display: inline flex</code>), which affects how the 
      container itself is laid out in the page. The legacy <code>inline-flex</code> 
      display value displays the container as inline as well. We'll focus on how 
      the the contents of the container behave in this tutorial, but if you want 
      to see the effect of inline versus block layout, you can have a look at the 
      **value comparison** on the <code>display</code> property page.

      The next sections explain in more detail what flex items are and what 
      happens inside an element when you make it a flex container.

      ## The flex model

      When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two axes:
        - The **main axis** is the axis running in the direction the flex items 
        are laid out in (for example, as a row across the page, or a column down 
        the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the **main start* and 
        **main end**.
        - The **cross axis** is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the 
        flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the 
        **cross start** and **cross end**.
        - The parent element that has <code>display: flex</code> set on it 
        (the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> in our example) is called the 
        **flex container**.
        - The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are 
        called **flex items** (the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements in our 
        example).
      
      Bear this terminology in mind as you go through subsequent sections. You 
      can always refer back to it if you get confused about any of the terms 
      being used.

      ## Columns or rows?

      Flexbox provides a property called <code>flex-direction</code> that 
      specifies which direction the main axis runs (which direction the flexbox 
      children are laid out in). By default this is set to <code>row</code>, which 
      causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default 
      language works in (left to right, in the case of an English browser).

      Try adding the following declaration to your <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> rule:

        ```
        flex-direction: column;
        ```
      You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much like they 
      were before we added any CSS. Before you move on, delete this declaration 
      from your example.

      **Note:** You can also lay out flex items in a reverse direction using the 
      <code>row-reverse</code> and </code>column-reverse</code> values. Experiment 
      with these values too!
      
      Try
        ```
        flex-direction: row-reverse; 
        ```
      or
        ```
        flex-direction: column-reverse; 
        ```
      ## Wrapping

      One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your layout 
      is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, 
      breaking the layout.

      Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their container. 
      One way in which you can fix this is to add the following declaration to 
      your <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> rule:

        ```
        .flexbox-wrapping section {
          display: flex;
          flex-wrap: wrap;
        }        
        ```
      Also, add the following declaration to your <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> rule:

        ```
        .flexbox-wrapping article {
          flex: 200px;
        }         
        ```
      
      We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children fitted 
      into it as is sensible. Any overflow is moved down to the next line. 
      The <code>flex: 200px</code> declaration set on the articles means that 
      each will be at least 200px wide. We'll discuss this property in more 
      detail later on. You might also notice that the last few children on the 
      last row are each made wider so that the entire row is still filled.

      But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your 
      <code>flex-direction</code> property value to </code>row-reverse</code>. 
      Now you'll see that you still have your multiple row layout, but it starts 
      from the opposite corner of the browser window and flows in reverse.
        
      ## flex-flow shorthand

      At this point it's worth noting that a shorthand exists for 
      <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap: flex-flow</code>. So, for 
      example, you can replace

        ```
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        ```

        with

        ```
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        ```

      ## Flexible sizing of flex items

      Let's now return to our first example and look at how we can control what 
      proportion of space flex items take up compared to the other flex items.

      First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:

        ```
        article {
          flex: 1;
        }
        ```
      This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much available space 
      along the main axis each flex item will take up compared to other flex items. 
      In this case, we're giving each <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element the same 
      value (a value of 1), which means they'll all take up an equal amount of the 
      spare space left after properties like padding and margin have been set. This 
      value is proportionally shared among the flex items: giving each flex item a 
      value of 400000 would have exactly the same effect.

      Now add the following rule below the previous one:
        
        ```
        article:nth-of-type(3) {
          flex: 2;
        }
        ```
      Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third <article> takes up twice as 
      much of the available width as the other two. There are now four proportion 
      units available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4). The first two flex items 
      have one unit each, so they each take 1/4 of the available space. The third 
      one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the available space (or one-half).

      You can also specify a minimum size value within the flex value. Try 
      updating your existing article rules like so:
      
        ```
        article {
          flex: 1 200px;
        }
        
        article:nth-of-type(3) {
          flex: 2 200px;
        }
        ```
      This basically states, &quot;Each flex item will first be given 200px of 
      the available space. After that, the rest of the available space will be 
      shared according to the proportion units.&quot; Try refreshing and you'll 
      see a difference in how the space is shared.

      The real value of flexbox can be seen in its flexibility/responsiveness. 
      If you resize the browser window or add another <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> 
      element, the layout continues to work just fine.

      ## flex: shorthand versus longhand

      flex is a shorthand property that can specify up to three different values:

        - The unitless proportion value we discussed above. This can be specified 
        separately using the <code>flex-grow</code> longhand property.
        - A second unitless proportion value, <code>flex-shrink</code>, which comes into play 
        when the flex items are overflowing their container. This value specifies 
        how much an item will shrink in order to prevent overflow. This is quite 
        an advanced flexbox feature and we won't be covering it any further in 
        this article.
        - The minimum size value we discussed above. This can be specified 
        separately using the <code>flex-basis</code> longhand value.
      
      We'd advise against using the longhand flex properties unless you really 
      have to (for example, to override something previously set). They lead to a 
      lot of extra code being written, and they can be somewhat confusing.

      ## Horizontal and vertical alignment
      
      You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the main or 
      cross axis. Let's explore this by looking at a new example:

      The following CSS will be used:

        ```
        div {
          display: flex;
          align-items: center;
          justify-content: space-around;
        }
        ```
      <code>align-items</code> controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.

      - By default, the value is stretch, which stretches all flex items to fill 
      the parent in the direction of the cross axis. If the parent doesn't have 
      a fixed height in the cross axis direction, then all flex items will become 
      as tall as the tallest flex item. This is how our first example had columns 
      of equal height by default.
      - The center value that we used in our above code causes the items to maintain 
      their intrinsic dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis. This is why 
      our current example's buttons are centered vertically.
      - You can also have values like flex-start and flex-end, which will align all 
      items at the start and end of the cross axis respectively. 
      See <code>align-items</code> for the full details.

      You can override the <code>align-items</code> behavior for individual flex 
      items by applying the <code>align-self</code> property to them. For example, 
      try adding the following to your CSS:

        ```
        button:first-child {
          align-self: flex-end;
        }
        ```
      <code>justify-content</code> controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.

      - The default value is <code>flex-start</code>, which makes all the items 
      sit at the start of the main axis.
      - You can use <code>flex-end</code> to make them sit at the end.
      - <code>center</code> is also a value for justify-content. It'll make the 
      flex items sit in the center of the main axis.
      - The value we've used above, <code>space-around</code>, is useful — it 
      distributes all the items evenly along the main axis with a bit of space 
      left at either end.
      - There is another value, <code>space-between</code>, which is very similar 
      to <code>space-around</code> except that it doesn't leave any space at either 
      end.

    The <code>justify-items</code> property is ignored in flexbox layouts.

    We'd like to encourage you to play with these values to see how they work 
    before you continue.

    Ordering flex items

    Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items without 
    affecting the source order. This is another thing that is impossible to do 
    with traditional layout methods.
    
    The code for this is simple. Try adding the following CSS to your button bar 
    example code:

      ```
      .horizontal-and-vertical-alignment button:first-child {
        order: 1;
      }
      ```
    Refresh and you'll see that the &quot;Smile&quot; button has moved to the 
    end of the main axis. Let's talk about how this works in a bit more detail:

      - By default, all flex items have an <code>order</code> value of 0.
      - Flex items with higher specified order values will appear later in the 
      display order than items with lower order values.
      - Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source order. 
      So if you have four items whose order values have been set as 2, 1, 1, and 
      0 respectively, their display order would be 4th, 2nd, 3rd, then 1st.
      - The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order value 
      and is after it in the source order.

    You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than items 
    whose value is 0. For example, you could make the &quot;Blush&quot; button 
    appear at the start of the main axis using the following rule:

      ```
      .horizontal-and-vertical-alignment button:last-child {
        order: -1;
      }
      ```
    ## Nested flex boxes

    It's possible to create some pretty complex layouts with flexbox. It's 
    perfectly OK to set a flex item to also be a flex container, so that its 
    children are also laid out like flexible boxes.

    The HTML for this is fairly simple. We've got a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> 
    element containing three <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s. The third 
    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> contains three <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, 
    and the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> contains five <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s:

    Let's look at the code we've used for the layout.

    First of all, we set the children of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to 
    be laid out as flexible boxes.

      ```
      .sample-flexbox-example section {
        display: flex;
      }      
      ```
    Next, we set some flex values on the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>s themselves. 
    Take special note of the second rule here: we're setting the third 
    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to have its children laid out like flex items 
    too, but this time we're laying them out like a column.

      ```
      .nested-flex-boxes  article {
        flex: 1 200px;
      }
      
      .nested-flex-boxes article:nth-of-type(3) {
        flex: 3 200px;
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: column;
      }
      ```
    
    Next, we select the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> inside the third 
    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. We first use <code>flex: 1 100px;</code> to 
    effectively give it a minimum height of 100px, then we set its children 
    (the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements) to also be laid out like flex items. 
    Here we lay them out in a wrapping row and align them in the center of the 
    available space as we did with the individual button example we saw earlier.

      ```
      .nested-flex-boxes article:nth-of-type(3) div {
        display: flex;
        flex: 1 100px;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: space-around;
      }
      ```
    
    Finally, we set some sizing on the button. This time by giving it a flex value 
    of 1 auto. This has a very interesting effect, which you'll see if you try 
    resizing your browser window width. The buttons will take up as much space as 
    they can. As many will fit on a line as is comfortable; beyond that, they'll 
    drop to a new line.

      ```
      .nested-flex-boxes button {
        flex: 1 auto;
        margin: 5px;
        font-size: 18px;
        line-height: 1.5;
      }
      ```
