      ## A simple flexbox-based responsive design

      In Flexbox, flex items shrink or grow, distributing space between the items 
      according to the space in their container. By changing the values for 
      `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` you can indicate how you want the items to 
      behave when they encounter more or less space around them. 

      In the example below the flex items will each take an equal amount of space 
      in the flex container, using the shorthand of `flex: 1` as described in the 
      layout topic [Flexbox: Flexible sizing of flex items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox#flexible_sizing_of_flex_items).

          One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers
          sat over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay,
          watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide
          chimney. Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were
          papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds
          and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
          millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires
          without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”
