    Task 3 - In this task, you have two images in boxes. One image is 
    smaller than the box, the other is larger and breaking out of the box. 
    If you imagine that the box is responsive and therefore could grow and 
    shrink, which property would you apply to the image so that the large i
    mage shrinks down into the box but the small image does not stretch.">
