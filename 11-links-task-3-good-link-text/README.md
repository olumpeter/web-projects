# Links - Task 3: Using clear link wordings

This third task creates a link to an info page about Narwhals, a link to a support email address, and a link to a PDF factfile that is 4MB in size. The aim of this task is to ensure that the link text is written using clear link wordings so that they can be _accessible_ to all readers, regardless of their current context and which tools they prefer.
