      content="# CSS layout - Positioning: Absolute positioning

      Absolute positioning brings very different results.

      ### Setting `position: absolute`

      Let's try changing the position declaration in your code as follows:

      ```
      position: absolute;
      ```

      If you now save and refresh, you should see something like so:

      First of all, note that the gap where the positioned element should be in the 
      document flow is no longer there — the first and third elements have closed 
      together like it no longer exists! Well, in a way, this is true. An absolutely 
      positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it 
      sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it 
      means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the 
      layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, 
      control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped 
      anywhere on the page, and so on.

      Second, notice that the position of the element has changed. This is because 
      `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` behave in a different way with absolute 
      positioning. Rather than positioning the element based on its relative position 
      within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be 
      from each of the containing element's sides. So in this case, we are saying that 
      the absolutely positioned element should sit 30px from the top of the 
      &quot;containing element&quot; and 30px from the left. (In this case, the t
      &quot;containing element&quot; is the **initial containing block**. See the section 
      below for more information).

      **Note**: You can use `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to resize elements 
      if you need to. Try setting top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0; and 
      margin: 0; on your positioned elements and see what happens! Put it back again 
      afterwards…

      **Note:** Yes, margins still affect positioned elements. Margin collapsing 
      doesn't, however.

      ### Positioning contexts

      Which element is the &quot;containing element&quot; of an absolutely positioned 
      element? This is very much dependent on the position property of the ancestors 
      of the positioned element ([See Identifying the containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block)).

      If no ancestor elements have their position property explicitly defined, then 
      by default all ancestor elements will have a static position. The result of 
      this is the absolutely positioned element will be contained in the initial 
      containing block. The initial containing block has the dimensions of the 
      viewport and is also the block that contains the `&lt;html&gt;` element. In 
      other words, the absolutely positioned element will be displayed outside of 
      the `&lt;html&gt;` element and be positioned relative to the initial viewport.

      The positioned element is nested inside the &lt;body&gt; in the HTML source, 
      but in the final layout it's 30px away from the top and the left edges of the 
      page. We can change the positioning context, that is, which element the 
      absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to. This is done by 
      setting positioning on one of the element's ancestors: to one of the elements 
      it's nested inside of (you can't position it relative to an element it's not 
      nested inside of). To see this, add the following declaration to your body rule:

      ```
      position: relative;
      ```

      ### Introducing z-index

      All this absolute positioning is good fun, but there's another feature we haven't 
      considered yet. When elements start to overlap, what determines which elements 
      appear over others and which elements appear under others? In the example we've 
      seen so far, we only have one positioned element in the positioning context, and 
      it appears on the top since positioned elements win over non-positioned elements. 
      What about when we have more than one?

      ```
      p:nth-of-type(1) {
        position: absolute;
        background: lime;
        top: 10px;
        right: 30px;
      }
      ```

      At this point you'll see the first paragraph colored lime, moved out of the 
      document flow, and positioned a bit above from where it originally was. It's 
      also stacked below the original `.positioned` paragraph where the two overlap. 
      This is because the `.positioned` paragraph is the second paragraph in the 
      source order, and positioned elements later in the source order win over 
      positioned elements earlier in the source order.

      Can you change the stacking order? Yes, you can, by using the z-index property. 
      &quot;z-index&quot; is a reference to the z-axis. You may recall from previous 
      points in the course where we discussed web pages using horizontal (x-axis) and 
      vertical (y-axis) coordinates to work out positioning for things like background 
      images and drop shadow offsets. For languages that run left to right, (0,0) is 
      at the top left of the page (or element), and the x- and y-axes run across to 
      the right and down the page.

      Web pages also have a z-axis: an imaginary line that runs from the surface of 
      your screen towards your face (or whatever else you like to have in front of 
      the screen). z-index values affect where positioned elements sit on that axis; 
      positive values move them higher up the stack, negative values move them lower 
      down the stack. By default, positioned elements all have a z-index of auto, 
      which is effectively 0.

      To change the stacking order, try adding the following declaration to your 
      p:nth-of-type(1) rule:

      ```
      z-index: 1;
      ```

      You should now see the lime paragraph on top:

      Note that z-index only accepts unitless index values; you can't specify that 
      you want one element to be 23 pixels up the Z-axis — it doesn't work like 
      that. Higher values will go above lower values and it's up to you what values 
      you use. Using values of 2 or 3 would give the same effect as values of 300 or 
      40000.
