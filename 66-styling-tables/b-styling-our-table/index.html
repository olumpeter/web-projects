    Spacing and layout - The first thing we need to do is sort out the 
    spacing/layout — default table styling is so cramped! To do this, add the 
    following CSS to your style.css file:
    
    /* spacing and layout*/

    table {
      table-layout: fixed;
      width: 100%;
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 3px solid purple;
    }

    thead th:nth-child(1) {
      width: 30%;
    }

    thead th:nth-child(2) {
      width: 20%;
    }

    thead th:nth-child(3) {
      width: 15%;
    }

    thead th:nth-child(4) {
      width: 35%;
    }

    th,
    td {
      padding: 20px;
    }

    The most important parts to note are as follows:

    - A table-layout value of fixed is generally a good idea to set on your table, 
    as it makes the table behave a bit more predictably by default. Normally, 
    table columns tend to be sized according to how much content they contain, 
    which produces some strange results. With table-layout: fixed, you can size 
    your columns according to the width of their headings, and then deal with 
    their content as appropriate. This is why we've selected the four different 
    headings with the thead th:nth-child(n) (:nth-child) selector (&quot;Select 
    the n-th child that is a &lt;th&gt; element in a sequence, inside a &lt;thead&gt; 
    element&quot;) and given them set percentage widths. The entire column width 
    follows the width of its heading, making for a nice way to size your table 
    columns. We've coupled this with a width of 100%, meaning that the table will 
    fill any container it is put in, and be nicely responsive (although it would 
    still need some more work to get it looking good on narrow screen widths).
    - A border-collapse value of collapse is standard best practice for any table 
    styling effort. By default, when you set borders on table elements, they will 
    all have spacing between them.
    - We've put a border around the whole table, which is needed because we'll be 
    putting some borders round the table header and footer later on — it looks 
    really odd and disjointed when you don't have a border round the whole outside 
    of the table and end up with gaps.
    - We've set some padding on the &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt; elements — this 
    gives the data items some space to breathe, making the table look a lot more 
    legible.
    
    Some simple typography - Now we'll get our text sorted out a bit. First of all, 
    we've found a font on Google Fonts that is suitable for a table about punk 
    bands. You can go there and find a different one if you like; you'll just have 
    to replace our provided &lt;link&gt; element and custom font-family declaration 
    with the ones Google Fonts gives you. First, add the following &lt;link&gt; 
    element into your HTML head, just above your existing &lt;link&gt; element:
    
    &lt;link
      href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rock+Salt&quot;
      rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
      type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;

    Now add the following CSS into your style.css file, below the previous addition:
    /* typography */

    html {
      font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot;, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
    }

    thead th,
    tfoot th {
      font-family: &quot;Rock Salt&quot;, cursive;
    }

    th {
      letter-spacing: 2px;
    }

    td {
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    tbody td {
      text-align: center;
    }

    tfoot th {
      text-align: right;
    }


    Graphics and colors - Now onto graphics and colors! Because the table is full 
    of punk and attitude, we need to give it some bright imposing styling to 
    suit it. Don't worry, you don't have to make your tables this loud — you can 
    opt for something more subtle and tasteful.

    Start by adding the following CSS to your style.css file, again at the bottom:

    thead,
    tfoot {
      background: url(leopardskin.jpg);
      color: white;
      text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;
    }

    thead th,
    tfoot th,
    tfoot td {
      background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgb(0 0 0 / 10%), rgb(0 0 0 / 50%));
      border: 3px solid purple;
    }

    
    Zebra striping - zebra stripes — alternating rows of color that make the 
    different data rows in your table easier to parse and read. Add the following 
    CSS to the bottom of your style.css file:

    /* zebra striping */

    tbody tr:nth-child(odd) {
      background-color: #ff33cc;
    }

    tbody tr:nth-child(even) {
      background-color: #e495e4;
    }

    tbody tr {
      background-image: url(noise.png);
    }

    table {
      background-color: #ff33cc;
    }

    Styling the caption - There is one last thing to do with our table — style 
    the caption. To do this, add the following to the bottom of your style.css 
    file:

    /* caption */

    caption {
      font-family: &quot;Rock Salt&quot;, cursive;
      padding: 20px;
      font-style: italic;
      caption-side: bottom;
      color: #666;
      text-align: right;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    Table styling quick tips - 

    - Make your table markup as simple as possible, and keep things flexible, 
    e.g. by using percentages, so the design is more responsive.
    - Use table-layout: fixed to create a more predictable table layout that 
    allows you to easily set column widths by setting width on their headings (&lt;th&gt;).
    - Use border-collapse: collapse to make table elements borders collapse into 
    each other, producing a neater and easier to control look.
    - Use &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, and &lt;tfoot&gt; to break up your table 
    into logical chunks and provide extra places to apply CSS to, so it is easier 
    to layer styles on top of one another if required.
    - Use zebra striping to make alternative rows easier to read.
    - Use text-align to line up your &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt; text, to make 
    things neater and easier to follow.
