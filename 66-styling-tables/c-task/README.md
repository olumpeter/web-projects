# Styling tables: Task

In this task, we are going to style the same table, but using some good practices for table design. Do the following:
    
- Add padding of <code>0.3em</code> to the table headings and data and align them at the top of their cells.
- Align headings and data for columns containing numbers right.
- Align headings and data for columns containing text left.
- Add a <code>1px</code> top and bottom solid border with the hex color <code>#999</code>, plus a 1px solid border of the same color above the footer.
- Remove the default spacing between the table elements borders to get the expected result.
- Stripe every odd row of the main table with the hex color <code>#eee</code>.
