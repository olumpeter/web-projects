    backgrounds: A gradient — when used for a background — acts just like an 
    image and is also set by using the background-image property. In this project
    we try some different gradients in the example below. In the two boxes 
    respectively, we have a linear gradient that is stretched over the whole 
    box, and a radial gradient with a set size, which therefore repeats.">
