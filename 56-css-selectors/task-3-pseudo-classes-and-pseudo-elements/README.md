# Task 3 - Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

In this task, we want you to make the following changes without adding to the HTML:
- Style links, making the link-state orange, visited links green, and remove the underline on hover.
- Make the first element inside the container font-size: 150% and the first line of that element red. 
- Stripe every other row in the table by selecting these rows and giving them a background color of #333 and foreground of white.
