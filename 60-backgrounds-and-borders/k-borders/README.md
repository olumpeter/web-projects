# Backgrounds and borders - Borders
In this project, we will look at how to use borders creatively. Typically when we add borders to an element with CSS we use a shorthand property that sets the <code>color</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>style</code> of the border in one line of CSS.

We can set a border for all four sides of a box with <code>border</code>. For instance: <code>border: 1px solid black;</code>

Or we can target one edge of the box, for instance: <code>border-top: 1px solid black;</code>

There are a variety of styles that you can use for borders. In this project, we have used two different border styles for the box and two different border styles for the heading. 

Play with the border <code>style</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>color</code> to see how borders work.
