# Creating your first table

Note that the content of every table is enclosed by these two tags: <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;table&gt;</code>. The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created by a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> element (<code>&quot;td&quot;</code> stands for &quot;table data&quot;). To create a row, you need to use the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> element (<code>&quot;tr&quot;</code> stands for &quot;table row&quot;). Also, take note that for a table to be useful, it must be accompanied by the CSS stylesheet."
