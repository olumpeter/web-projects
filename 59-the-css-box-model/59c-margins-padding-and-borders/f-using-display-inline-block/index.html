    inline-block is a special value of display, which provides a middle ground 
    between inline and block. Use it if you do not want an item to break onto a 
    new line, but do want it to respect width and height and avoid the overlapping 
    seen above.
    
    In this project, we have added display: inline-block to our &lt;span&gt; 
    element. Try changing this to display: block or removing the line completely 
    to see the difference in display models.">

      <p>
        I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. 
        A span is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.
