    Viewport units: The viewport — which is the visible area of your page 
    in the browser you are using to view a site — also has a size. In CSS 
    we have units which relate to the size of the viewport — the vw unit 
    for viewport width, and vh for viewport height. Using these units you 
    can size something relative to the viewport of the user.

    1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height, and 1vw is equal to 1% of 
    the viewport width. You can use these units to size boxes, but also 
    text. In this project, we have a box which is sized as 20vh and 20vw. 
    The box contains a letter A, which has been given a font-size of 10vh.
    
    If you change the vh and vw values this will change the size of the box 
    or font; changing the viewport size will also change their sizes because 
    they are sized relative to the viewport.
    
    Sizing things according to the viewport can be useful in your designs. 
    For example, if you want a full-page hero section to show before the 
    rest of your content, making that part of your page 100vh high will 
    push the rest of the content below the viewport, meaning that it will 
    only appear once the document is scrolled.">
