      content="# Styling text: Typesetting a community school homepage
      ## Project brief
      You've been provided with some raw HTML for the homepage of an imaginary 
      community college, plus some CSS that styles the page into a three column 
      layout and provides some other rudimentary styling. You're to write your 
      CSS additions below the comment at the bottom of the CSS file to make sure 
      it's easy to mark the bits you've done. Don't worry if some of the selectors 
      are repetitious; we'll let you off in this instance.
      
      ### Fonts

      - First of all, download a couple of free-to-use fonts. Because this is a 
      college, the fonts should be chosen to give the page a fairly serious, 
      formal, trustworthy feel: a serif site-wide font for the general body text, 
      coupled with a sans-serif or slab serif for the headings might be nice.
      - Use a suitable service to generate bulletproof @font-face code for these 
      two fonts.
      - Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your 
      headings.

      ### General text styling
      
      - Give the page a site-wide font-size of 10px.
      - Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined 
      using a suitable relative unit.
      - Give your body text a suitable line-height.
      - Center your top level heading on the page.
      - Give your headings a little bit of letter-spacing to make them not too 
      squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.
      - Give your body text some letter-spacing and word-spacing, as appropriate.
      - Give the first paragraph after each heading in the &lt;section&gt; a 
      little bit of text-indentation, say 20px.

      ### Links:

      - Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states some colors that go with 
      the color of the horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.
      - Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or 
      focus them the underline disappears.
      - Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.
      - Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out 
      nicely, but make it still fit in with the overall page design.
      - Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next 
      to them.

      ### Lists:

      - Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the 
      styling of the overall page. Each list item should have the same line-height 
      as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top 
      and bottom as you have between paragraphs.
      - Give your list items a nice bullet appropriate for the design of the page. 
      It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.

      ### Navigation menu:

      - Style your navigation menu so that it harmonizes with the page.

      ## Hints and tips
      
      - You don't need to edit the HTML in any way for this exercise.
      - You don't necessarily have to make the nav menu look like buttons, but it 
      needs to be a bit taller so that it doesn't look silly on the side of the 
      page; also remember that you need to make this one a vertical nav menu.

          <h2>Brave new world</h2>
    
          <p>
            It's a brave new world out there. Our children are being put in 
            increasing more competitive situations, both during recreation, and 
            as they start to move into the adult world of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examination">examinations</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs">jobs</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career">careers</a>, 
            and other life choices. Having the wrong mindset, becoming 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion">too emotional</a>, 
            or making the wrong choices can contribute to them experiencing 
            difficulty in taking their rightful place in today's ideal society.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            As concerned parents, guardians or carers, you will no doubt want to 
            give your children the best possible start in life â€” and you've come 
            to the right place.
          </p>
    
          <h2>The best start in life</h2>
    
          <p>
            At St. Huxley's, we pride ourselves in not only giving our students a 
            top quality education, but also giving them the societal and emotional 
            intelligence they need to win big in the coming utopia. We not only 
            excel at subjects such as genetics, data mining, and chemistry, but we 
            also include compulsory lessons in:
          </p>
    
          <ul>
            <li>Emotional control</li>
            <li>Judgement</li>
            <li>Assertion</li>
            <li>Focus and resolve</li>
          </ul>
    
          <p>
            If you are interested, then you next steps will likely be to:
