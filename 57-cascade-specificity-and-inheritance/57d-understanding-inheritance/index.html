    <meta name="description" content="Understanding inheritance: The color 
    property is an inherited property. So, the color property value is applied 
    to the direct children and also to the indirect children.  — the immediate 
    child &lt;li&gt;s and those inside the first nested list. We have then added 
    the class special to the second nested list and applied a different color to 
    it. This then inherits down through its children. Properties like width 
    (as mentioned earlier), margin, padding, and border are not inherited 
    properties. If a border were to be inherited by the children in this list 
    example, every single list and list item would gain a border — probably not 
    an effect we would ever want!">
