# CSS layout - Positioning: Introducing positioning

Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make 
them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another or by 
always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article 
explains the different position values and how to use them

Positioning allows us to produce interesting results by overriding normal 
document flow. What if you want to slightly alter the position of some boxes 
from their default flow position to give a slightly quirky, distressed feel? 
Positioning is your tool. Or what if you want to create a UI element that 
floats over the top of other parts of the page and/or always sits in the same 
place inside the browser window no matter how much the page is scrolled? 
Positioning makes such layout work possible.

There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put into 
effect on HTML elements. To make a specific type of positioning active on an 
element, we use the `position` property.
