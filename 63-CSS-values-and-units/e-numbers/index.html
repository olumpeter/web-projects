    Numbers - Some value types accept numbers, without any unit added to them. 
    An example of a property which accepts a unitless number is the opacity 
    property, which controls the opacity of an element (how transparent it is). 
    This property accepts a number between 0 (fully transparent) and 
    1 (fully opaque).

    In this project, try changing the value of opacity to various decimal values 
    between 0 and 1 and see how the box and its contents become more or less 
    opaque.">
