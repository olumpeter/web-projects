    <meta name="description" content="Resolution switching: Same size, 
    different resolutions. This projects shows how you can allow the 
    browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcset attribute 
    with x-descriptors and without sizes attribute - the browser works out what 
    resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most 
    appropriate image referenced in the srcset. So if the device accessing the 
    page has a standard/low resolution display, with one device pixel representing 
    each CSS pixel, the elva-fairy-320w.jpg image will be loaded (the 1x is implied, 
    so you don't need to include it.) If the device has a high resolution of two 
    device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the elva-fairy-640w.jpg image will be 
    loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB..">
