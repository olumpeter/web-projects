    Exploring an example -In this project, you can see how some relative and 
    absolute length units behave. 
    
    The first box has a width set in pixels. As an absolute unit, this 
    width will remain the same no matter what else changes. 
    
    The second box has a width set in vw (viewport width) units. This value is 
    relative to the viewport width, and so 10vw is 10 percent of the width of the 
    viewport. If you change the width of your browser window, the size of the box 
    should change.
    
    The third box uses em units. These are relative to the font size. I've set a 
    font size of 1em on the containing &lt;div&gt;, which has a class of .wrapper. 
    Change this value to 1.5em and you will see that the font size of all the 
    elements increases, but only the last item will get wider, as its width is 
    relative to that font size.">
