    you can see two boxes. Both have a class of .box, which gives them the same 
    width, height, margin, border, and padding. The only difference is that the 
    second box has been set to use the alternative box model. 

    Can you change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the .alternate 
    class) to make it match the first box in width and height?">
