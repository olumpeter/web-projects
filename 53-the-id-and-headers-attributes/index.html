    <meta name="description" content="The id and headers attributes: An alternative 
    to using the scope attribute is to use id and headers attributes to create 
    associations between headers and cells. The way they are used is as follows:
    1. You add a unique id to each &lt;th&gt; element.
    2. You add a headers attribute to each &lt;td&gt; element. Each headers 
    attribute has to contain a list of the ids of all the &lt;th&gt; elements 
    that act as a header for that cell, separated by spaces.
    This gives your HTML table an explicit definition of the position of each 
    cell in the table, defined by the header(s) for each column and row it is 
    part of, kind of like a spreadsheet. For it to work well, the table really 
    needs both column and row headers. Note: This method creates very precise 
    associations between headers and data cells but it uses a lot more markup and 
    does not leave any room for errors. The scope approach is usually enough for 
    most tables.">
