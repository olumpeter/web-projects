      content="# CSS layout - Positioning: Fixed positioning
      Let's now look at fixed positioning. This works in exactly the same way as 
      absolute positioning, with one key difference: whereas absolute positioning 
      fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the 
      initial containing block if there isn't one), **fixed positioning** *usually* 
      fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An 
      exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing 
      block because its [transform property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) 
      has a value other than none.) This means that you can create useful UI items 
      that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always 
      visible no matter how much the page scrolls.

      Let's put together a simple example to show what we mean. First of all, delete 
      the existing `p:nth-of-type(1)` and `.positioned` rules from your CSS.

      Now update the `body` rule to remove the `position: relative;` declaration and 
      add a fixed height, like so:

      ```
      body {
        width: 500px;
        height: 1400px;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
      ```

      Now we're going to give the `h1` element `position: fixed;` and have it sit at 
      the top of the viewport. Add the following rule to your CSS:

      ```
      h1 {
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        width: 500px;
        margin-top: 0;
        background: white;
        padding: 10px;
      }
      ```
      The `top: 0;` is required to make it stick to the top of the screen. We 
      give the heading the same width as the content column and then a white 
      background and some padding and margin so the content won't be visible 
      underneath it.
      
      If you save and refresh, you'll see a fun little effect of the heading 
      staying fixed — the content appears to scroll up and disappear underneath 
      it. But notice how some of the content is initially clipped under the 
      heading. This is because the positioned heading no longer appears in the 
      document flow, so the rest of the content moves up to the top. We could 
      improve this by moving the paragraphs all down a bit. We can do this by 
      setting some top margin on the first paragraph. Add this now:    
      ">
    
    <title>Fixed positioning</title>

    <link 
      href="styles/style.css" 
      rel="stylesheet" 
      type="text/css">

  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Fixed positioning</h1>

    <div class="basic-document-flow">
      <h2>Basic document flow</h2>

      <p>
        I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on 
        new lines below me.
      </p>

      <p class="positioned ">
        By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height 
        is as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + 
        padding + border width/height.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are 
        separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on 
        the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on 
        the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if 
        possible — like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line 
        if not, much like this image will do: 
        <img src="long.jpg" alt="a wide but short section of a photo of several fabrics">
      </p>  
    </div>

    
  </body>
