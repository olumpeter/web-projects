# Table headers

To recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you can use the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> element (&quot;th&quot; stands for &quot;table header&quot;). This works in exactly the same way as a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell. Table headers are useful because it is easier to find the data you are looking for when the headers clearly stand out, and the design just generally looks better. Note that Table headings come with some default styling — they are bold and centered even if you don't add your own styling to the table, to help them stand out. Tables headers also have an added benefit — along with the <code>scope</code> attribute, they allow you to make tables more accessible by associating each header with all the data in the same row or column. Screen readers are then able to read out a whole row or column of data at once, which is pretty useful.
