    Using overflow: auto - If you only want scrollbars to appear when there is 
    more content than can fit in the box, use overflow: auto. This allows the 
    browser to determine if it should display scrollbars.
    
    In this project, remove content until it fits into the box. You should see 
    the scrollbars disappear.">

        This box has a height and a width. This means that if there is too much 
        content to be displayed within the assigned height, there will be an 
        overflow situation. If overflow is set to hidden then any overflow will 
        not be visible.

        This content is outside of the box.
