    project, we have a &lt;span&gt; inside a paragraph. We have applied a width, 
    height, margin, border, and padding to it. You can see that the width and 
    height are ignored. The top and bottom margin, padding, and border are 
    respected but don't change the relationship of other content to our inline 
    box. The padding and border overlap other words in the paragraph. The left 
    and right padding, margins, and borders move other content away from the box.">

      <p>
        I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. 
        A span is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.
