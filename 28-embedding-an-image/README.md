# Embedding an image

This task is a simple embedding activity that required you to embed the image located at  this URL:

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg

To avoid hotlinking to the image, its advisable to download it first to a folder called images in your working directory so that you can use relative URL instead of Absolute URL. Use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> HTML element with the <code>alt</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>title</code> attributes to embed the image.
