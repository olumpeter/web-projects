# Sizing items in CSS: Task 2 

In this task, you have a box, which contains another box. Your task is to make the inner box 60% of the width of the outer box. The value of the <code>box-sizing</code> property is set to <code>border-box</code>, which means that the total width includes any **padding** and **border**. You should also give the inner box <code>padding</code> of <code>10%</code> using the <code>width</code> (or inline size) as the size from which that percentage is calculated.
