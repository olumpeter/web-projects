    Line height units - lh and rlh are relative lengths units similar to em 
    and rem. The difference between lh and rlh is that the first one is relative 
    to the line height of the element itself, while the second one is relative 
    to the line height of the root element, usually &lt;html&gt;.
    
    In this project, we use lh unit to create notepad-like lines using 
    repeating-linear-gradient(). It doesn't matter what's the line height 
    of the text, the lines will always start in the right place.">

        Summer is a time for adventure, and this year was no exception. I had 
        many exciting experiences, but two of my favorites were my trip to the 
        beach and my week at summer camp.

        At the beach, I spent my days swimming, collecting shells, and building
        sandcastles. I also went on a boat ride and saw dolphins swimming 
        alongside us.
