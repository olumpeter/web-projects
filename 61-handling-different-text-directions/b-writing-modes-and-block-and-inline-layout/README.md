# Handling different text directions: Logical properties and values

CSS has recently developed a set of mapped properties. These essentially replace physical properties — things like <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> — with logical, or flow relative versions.

The property mapped to <code>width</code> when in a horizontal writing mode is called <code>inline-size</code> — it refers to the size in the inline dimension. The property for <code>height</code> is named <code>block-size</code> and is the size in the block dimension. 

In this project, you can see how this works where we have replaced <code>width</code> with <code>inline-size</code>.
