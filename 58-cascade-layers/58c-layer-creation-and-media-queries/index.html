    project shows how changing the size of your device or browser may change 
    the layer order. In this example, we create the site layer only in wider 
    browsers. We then assign styles to the page and site layers, in that order. 
    In wide screens, the site layer is declared in the first line, meaning site 
    has less precedence than page. Otherwise, site has precedence over page 
    because it is declared later on narrow screens. ">
