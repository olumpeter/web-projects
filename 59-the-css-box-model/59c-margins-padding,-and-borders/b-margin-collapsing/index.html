    <meta name="description" content="Margins, padding, and borders - Margin 
    collapsing: In this project, you have two paragraphs. The top paragraph has 
    a margin-bottom of 50 pixels, the other has a margin-top of 30 pixels. The 
    margins have collapsed together so the actual margin between the boxes is 
    50 pixels and not the total of the two margins.

    You can test this by setting the margin-top of paragraph two to 0. The 
    visible margin between the two paragraphs will not change — it retains the 
    50 pixels set in the margin-bottom of paragraph one. If you set it to -10px, 
    you'll see that the overall margin becomes 40px — it subtracts from the 50px.">
