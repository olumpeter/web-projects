      ## Static positioning

      Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means 
      &quot;put the element into its normal position in the document flow — nothing 
      special to see here.&quot;
      
      To see this (and get your example set up for future sections) first add a class 
      of positioned to the second `&lt;p&gt;` in the HTML:

      Now add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:

      ```
      .positioned {
        position: static;
        background: yellow;
      }
      ```

      If you save and refresh, you'll see no difference at all, except for the 
      updated background color of the 2nd paragraph. This is fine — as we said 
      before, static positioning is the default behavior!


    ">
    
    <title>Static positioning</title>

      href="styles/style.css"

  <body>
    <h1>Static positioning</h1>

    <div class="basic-document-flow">
      <h2>Basic document flow</h2>

      <p>
        I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on 
        new lines below me.
      </p>

      <p class="positioned ">
        By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height 
        is as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + 
        padding + border width/height.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are 
        separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on 
        the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on 
        the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if 
        possible — like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line 
        if not, much like this image will do: 
        <img src="long.jpg" alt="a wide but short section of a photo of several fabrics">
      </p>  
    </div>
