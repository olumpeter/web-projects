    <meta name="description" content="Backgrounds and borders - Sizing the 
    background image: We can size the image to fit inside the background using 
    the following keywords: 
    
    - cover — the browser will make the image just large enough so that it 
    completely covers the box area while still retaining its aspect ratio. In 
    this case, part of the image is likely to end up outside the box.
    - contain — the browser will make the image the right size to fit inside 
    the box. In this case, you may end up with gaps on either side or on the 
    top and bottom of the image, if the aspect ratio of the image is different 
    from that of the box.
    
    Try the following:

    - Change the length units used to modify the size of the background. Remove the 
    length units and see what happens when you use background-size: cover or 
    background-size: contain.
    - If your image is smaller than the box, you can change the value of 
    background-repeat to repeat the image. ">
