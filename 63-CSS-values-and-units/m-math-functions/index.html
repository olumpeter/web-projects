    Math functions - When you are creating styles for a project, you will probably 
    start off with numbers like 300px for lengths or 200ms for durations. If you 
    want to have these values change based on other values, you will need to do 
    some math. You could calculate the percentage of a value or add a number to 
    another number, then update your CSS with the result.
    
    CSS has support for Math functions, which allow us to perform calculations 
    instead of relying on static values or doing the math in JavaScript. One of 
    the most common math functions is calc() which lets you do operations like 
    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.">
