# CSS values and units: Strings and identifiers

We've seen places where **keywords** are used as a value (for example <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> keywords like <code>red</code>, <code>black</code>, <code>rebeccapurple</code>, and <code>goldenrod</code>). These **keywords** are more accurately described as **identifiers**, a special value that CSS understands. As such they are not quoted â€” they are not treated as strings.

There are places where you use **strings** in CSS. For example, when specifying **generated content**. In this case, the value is quoted to demonstrate that it is a string. 
    
In this project, we use **unquoted color keywords** along with a **quoted generated content string**.
