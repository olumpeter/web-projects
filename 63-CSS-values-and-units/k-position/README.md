# CSS values and units: Position

The <code>&lt;position&gt;</code> value type represents a set of **2D coordinates**, used to position an item such as a **background image** (via <code>background-position</code>). It can take **keywords** such as <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>center</code> to align items with specific bounds of a **2D box**, along with lengths, which represent offsets from the top and left-hand edges of the box.

A typical **position value** consists of two values â€” the first sets the position **horizontally**, the second **vertically**. 

**If you only specify values for one axis the other will default to center.**
    
In this project, we have positioned a background image <code>40px</code> from the <code>top</code> and to the <code>right</code> of the container using a **keyword**.
