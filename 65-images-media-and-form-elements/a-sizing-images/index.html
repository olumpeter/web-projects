    Sizing images - Everything in CSS generates a box. If you place an image 
    inside a box that is smaller or larger than the intrinsic dimensions of the 
    image file in either direction, it will either appear smaller than the box, 
    or overflow the box. You need to make a decision about what happens with the 
    overflow.
    
    In this project, we have two boxes, both 200 pixels in size: 
    - One contains an image which is smaller than 200 pixels â€” it is smaller than 
    the box and doesn't stretch to fill it.
    - The other is larger than 200 pixels and overflows the box.
    
    So what can we do about the overflowing issue? A common technique is to make 
    the max-width of an image 100%. This will enable the image to become smaller 
    in size than the box but not larger. This technique will also work with other 
    replaced elements such as &lt;video&gt;s, or &lt;iframe&gt;s.
    
    Try adding max-width: 100% to the <img> element in the example above. You will 
    see that the smaller image remains unchanged, but the larger one becomes 
    smaller to fit into the box.
    
    You can make other choices about images inside containers. For example, you 
    may want to size an image so it completely covers a box. The object-fit 
    property can help you here. When using object-fit the replaced element can 
    be sized to fit a box in a variety of ways.
    
    In this project, we have used the value cover, which sizes the image down, 
    maintaining the aspect ratio so that it neatly fills the box. As the aspect 
    ratio is maintained, some parts of the image will be cropped by the box.
    
    If we use contain as a value, the image will be scaled down until it is small 
    enough to fit inside the box. This will result in &quot;letterboxing&quot; if 
    it is not the same aspect ratio as the box.
    
    You could also try the value of fill, which will fill the box but not maintain 
    the aspect ratio.">
