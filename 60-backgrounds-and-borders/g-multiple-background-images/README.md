# Backgrounds and borders - Multiple background images

This project shows that it is also possible to have multiple background images â€” you specify multiple background-image values in a single property value, separating each one with a comma.
    
When you do this you may end up with background images overlapping each other. The backgrounds will layer with the last listed background image at the bottom of the stack, and each previous image stacking on top of the one that follows it in the code.
