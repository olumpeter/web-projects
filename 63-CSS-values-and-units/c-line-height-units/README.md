# CSS values and units: Line height units

<code>lh</code> and <code>rlh</code> are **relative lengths units** similar to <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>. The difference between <code>lh</code> and <code>rlh</code> is that the first one is relative to the **line height of the element** itself, while the second one is relative to the **line height of the root element**, usually <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>.
    
In this project, we use <code>lh</code> unit to create notepad-like lines using <code>repeating-linear-gradient()</code>. It doesn't matter what's the line height of the text, the lines will always start in the right place.
