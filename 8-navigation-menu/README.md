# Creating a navigation menu

The goal of this project is to link some pages together with a navigation menu to create a multipage website. The same page structure is used on every page, including the same navigation menu, so when links are clicked it gives the impression that you are staying in the same place, and different content is being brought up.

## How you can access this live website
<p>Use the following URL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://olumpeter.github.io/web-projects/8-navigation-menu/</li>
</ul>
<p>or click the following link:</p> 
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://olumpeter.github.io/web-projects/8-navigation-menu/">
    Visit website</a></li>
</ul>
