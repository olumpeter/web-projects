      content="# CSS layout - Beginner's guide to media queries

      The **CSS Media Query** gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser 
      and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example 
      &quot;viewport is wider than 480 pixels&quot;. Media queries are a key 
      part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different 
      layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to 
      detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for 
      example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.

      ## Media Query Basics

      The simplest media query syntax looks like this:

      ```
      @media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {
        /* CSS rules go here */
      }
      ```

      It consists of:

      - A media type, which tells the browser what kind of media this code is 
      for (e.g. print, or screen).
      - A media expression, which is a rule, or test that must be passed for the 
      contained CSS to be applied.
      - A set of CSS rules that will be applied if the test passes and the media 
      type is correct.

      ### Media types

      - The possible types of media you can specify are:

        - all
        - print
        - screen

      The following media query will only set the body to 12pt if the page is 
      printed. It will not apply when the page is loaded in a browser.

      ```
      @media print {
        body {
          font-size: 12pt;
        }
      }
      ```

      >**Note**: The media type here is different from the so-called [MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type) type.
      
      >**Note:** There were a number of other media types defined in the Level 3 
      Media Queries specification; these have been deprecated and should be avoided.
      
      >**Note:** Media types are optional; if you do not indicate a media type in 
      your media query, then the media query will default to being for all media 
      types.

      ### Media feature rules

      After specifying the type, you can then target a media feature with a rule.

      #### Width and height

      The feature we tend to detect most often in order to create responsive 
      designs (and that has widespread browser support) is viewport width, and we 
      can apply CSS if the viewport is above or below a certain width — or an 
      exact width — using the `min-width`, `max-width`, and `width` media features.

      These features are used to create layouts that respond to different screen 
      sizes. For example, to change the body text color to red if the viewport 
      is exactly 600 pixels, you would use the following media query.

      ```CSS
      @media screen and (width: 600px) {
        .width-and-height-example-1 {
          color: red;
        }
      }
      ```

      The width (and height) media features can be used as ranges, and therefore 
      be prefixed with min- or max- to indicate that the given value is a 
      minimum, or a maximum. For example, to make the color blue if the viewport 
      is 600 pixels or narrower, use max-width:

      ```CSS
      @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
        .width-and-height-example-2 {
          color: blue;
        }
      }
      ```

      In practice, using minimum or maximum values is much more useful for 
      responsive design so you will rarely see `width` or `height` used alone.

      ### Orientation

      One well-supported media feature is orientation, which allows us to test 
      for portrait or landscape mode. To change the body text color if the device 
      is in landscape orientation, use the following media query.

      ```css
      @media (orientation: landscape) {
        .orientation-example-3 {
          color: rebeccapurple;
        }
      }
      ```

      A standard desktop view has a landscape orientation, and a design that 
      works well in this orientation may not work as well when viewed on a phone 
      or tablet in portrait mode. Testing for orientation can help you to create 
      a layout which is optimized for devices in portrait mode.

      ### Using ranged syntax

      One common case is to check if the viewport width is between two values:

      ```css
      @media (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) {
        /* … */
      }
      ```

      If you want to improve the readability of this, you can use &quot;range&quot; syntax:
      
      ```css
      @media (30em <= width <= 50em) {
        /* … */
      }
      ```

      ## More complex media queries

      With all of the different possible media queries, you may want to combine 
      them, or create lists of queries — any of which could be matched.

      ### &quot;and&quot; logic in media queries

      To combine media features you can use and in much the same way as we have 
      used and above to combine a media type and feature. For example, we might 
      want to test for a `min-width` and `orientation`. The body text will only be 
      blue if the viewport is at least 600 pixels wide and the device is in 
      landscape mode.

      ### &quot;or&quot; logic in media queries

      If you have a set of queries, any of which could match, then you can comma 
      separate these queries. In the below example the text will be blue if the 
      viewport is at least 600 pixels wide OR the device is in landscape orientation. 
      If either of these things are true the query matches.

      ### &quot;not&quot; logic in media queries

      You can negate an entire media query by using the `not` operator. This reverses 
      the meaning of the entire media query. Therefore in this next example the text 
      will only be blue if the orientation is portrait.

      ## How to choose breakpoints
      
      - In the early days of responsive design, many designers would attempt to target 
      very specific screen sizes. Lists of the sizes of the screens of popular phones 
      and tablets were published in order that designs could be created to neatly 
      match those viewports.
      
      There are now far too many devices, with a huge variety of sizes, to make that 
      feasible. This means that instead of targeting specific sizes for all designs, 
      a better approach is to change the design at the size where the content starts 
      to break in some way. Perhaps the line lengths become far too long, or a boxed 
      out sidebar gets squashed and hard to read. That's the point at which you want 
      to use a media query to change the design to a better one for the space you have 
      available. This approach means that it doesn't matter what the exact dimensions 
      are of the device being used, every range is catered for. The points at which a 
      media query is introduced are known as breakpoints.
      
      The [Responsive Design Mode](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/index.html) 
      in Firefox DevTools is very useful for working out where these breakpoints should 
      go. You can easily make the viewport smaller and larger to see where the content 
      would be improved by adding a media query and tweaking the design.
