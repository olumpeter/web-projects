# CSS layout - Test your skills: Responsive web design and media queries - Task

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to use media 
queries and get you working with responsive web design with a practical task.

## Responsive Web Design Marking Guide

This task not only asks the student to implement media queries correctly, they 
will also need to use the things they have learned about CSS Layout.

There is no one right answer however the following code demontrates how simply 
the task can be achieved, and this is really what we are looking for as it is 
easy to complicate this task. Using modern layout methods of flexbox and grid 
means that we only need one media query.
