# Backgrounds and borders - Task 2

In this task, we want you to add background images, a border, and some other styling to a decorative box:

1. Give the box a <code>5px lightblue border</code> and round the <code>top left corner 20px</code> and the <code>bottom right corner 40px</code>.
1. The heading uses the <code>star.png</code> image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.
1. Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered â€” you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this.
