    Using percentages - Percentages act like length units. When using a 
    percentage you need to be aware what it is a percentage of. In the case 
    of a box inside another container, if you give the child box a 
    percentage width it will be a percentage of the width of the parent 
    container.
    
    This is because percentages resolve against the size of the containing 
    block. With no percentage applied, our &lt;div&gt; would take up 100% 
    of the available space, as it is a block level element. If we give it 
    a percentage width, this becomes a percentage of the space it would 
    normally fill.">
