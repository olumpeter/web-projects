# Type and universal selectors

A **type selector** is sometimes referred to as a **tag name selector** or **element selector** because it selects an HTML tag/element in your document. Type selectors are not case-sensitive. 

The **universal selector** is indicated by an asterisk (<code>*</code>). It selects everything in the document (or inside the parent element if it is being chained together with another element and a descendant combinator). Instead of the default styling added by the browser — which spaces out headings and paragraphs with margins — everything is close together.
