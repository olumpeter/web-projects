# Backgrounds and borders - Background images

The <code>background-image</code> property enables the display of an image in the **background** of an element. In this project, we have two boxes â€” one has a **background image** which is larger than the **box** (<code>balloons.jpg</code>), the other has a small image of a single star (<code>star.png</code>).
    
This project demonstrates that by default, the large image is not scaled down to fit the box, so we only see a small corner of it, whereas the small image is tiled to fill the box.
    
If you specify a **background color** in addition to a **background image** then the image displays on top of the **color**. 

Try adding a <code>background-color</code> property to the example above to see that in action.
