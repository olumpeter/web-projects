    Setting a specific size - We can, of course, give elements in our 
    design a specific size. When a size is given to an element 
    (the content of which then needs to fit into that size) we refer to 
    it as an **extrinsic size**. Take our &lt;div&gt; from the previous 
    example â€” we can give it specific width and height values, and it will 
    now have that size no matter what content is placed into it. As we 
    discovered in our previous project on overflow, a set height can cause 
    content to overflow if there is more content than the element has space 
    to fit inside it.
    
    Due to this problem of overflow, fixing the height of elements with 
    lengths or percentages is something we need to do very carefully on 
    the web.">

          These boxes both have a height set, this box has content in it 
          which will need more space than the assigned height, and so we get 
          overflow.
