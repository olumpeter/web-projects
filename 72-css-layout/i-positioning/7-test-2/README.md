# CSS layout - Positioning: Task 2

In this task, we want you to position the item with a class of target to 
the top and right of the container, which has the 5px grey border.

## Additional question:

As an extra challenge, can you change the target to display underneath the 
text?

## Marking Guide

This task covers understanding of `position: relative` and 
`position: absolute` and how they relate to each other in terms of relative 
positioning creating a new positioning context.

A likely issue will be that the student adds `position: absolute` to the 
child but does not apply `position: relative` to the container. In that 
case the target will end up being positioned according to the viewport.

For the extra task, the student needs to add a negative z-index to the 
target, for example z-index: -2.
